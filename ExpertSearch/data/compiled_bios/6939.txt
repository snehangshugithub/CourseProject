Our study species is the song sparrow. We study function in the field, via a long-term banding, recording and radio-tracking program combined with field experiments (mostly playback studies). We study development both in the field, where we focus on young males we have banded in the nest or netted during their first summer, and in the laboratory, where we attempt to recreate the key conditions identified in the field studies. Our laboratory song-learning studies use multiple live EDUCATION: B. A. Reed College, 1963, Ph.D. Boston University, 1969.
