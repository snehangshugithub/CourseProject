McKay, Daniel J. July 1, 2014 McKay, Daniel J. Associate Professor, Biology Department and Genetics Department Affiliations: Department of Genetics dmckay1@email.unc.edu 3358 Genome Sciences Building (919) 843-2064 (office) Lab Website Research in the lab focuses on how a single genome gives rise to a variety of cell types and body parts during development. We use Drosophila as a model organism to investigate (1) how transcription factors access DNA to regulate complex patterns of gene expression, and (2) how post-translational modification of histones contributes to maintenance of gene expression programs over time. We combine genomic approaches (e.g. chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing) with Drosophila genetics and transgenesis to address both of these questions. Defects in cell fate specification and maintenance of cell identity often occur in human diseases, including cancer.
