Rhodes Hall 607/255-9014dag369@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyDavid A. Goldberg joined the School of Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE) at Cornell as an Associate Professor in August 2017. Previously, he had been the A. Russel Chandler III Associate Professor in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) at Georgia Tech. He received his Ph.D. in Operations Research at MIT in 2011, and his B.S. in Computer Science (minors in Operations Research and Applied Math) from Columbia University in 2006.Research InterestsGoldberg's research is in applied probability and stochastic processes, on topics including inventory and queueing models, combinatorial optimization, robust optimization, and multi-arm bandits. He uses tools from probability to develop novel algorithms and insights into fundamental models previously believed intractable, e.g. due to the curse of dimensionality, arising in many applications.AlgorithmsData ScienceApplied ProbabilityStatistics and Machine LearningResearch Group MembersTeaching InterestsAt the undergraduate level, Professor Goldberg has taught courses in probability modeling and dynamic programming. At the Ph.D. level, he has taught courses in advanced stochastic processes, the mathematics of operations research, and courses on more advanced topics ranging from inventory and queueing models to random graphs and multi-arm bandits. Professor Goldberg also looks forward to teaching at the masters level in both ORIE and the systems engineering program at Cornell. In addition, Goldberg has advised several Ph.D. students, and considers working with Ph.D. students one of the greatest parts of being a professor. He is also grateful to have been a Class of 1969 Teaching Fellow while at Georgia Tech.Service InterestsProfessor Goldberg is proud to serve on the editorial boards of Operations Research and Queueing Systems, as well as the INFORMS Applied Probability Society Council and as the cluster co-chair for the Applied Probability section of INFORMS in 2016. He cares deeply about the INFORMS Applied Probability Society, and looks forward to continuing his service and leadership while at Cornell. He has also served as a reviewer for many journals, paper prize committees, conference program committees, and NSF grant panels. In addition, Professor Goldberg takes part in many service activities at the department level, and has served on committees ranging from Ph.D. admissions to faculty hiring, curricular redesign, and the organization of alumni parties.Selected PublicationsI.
