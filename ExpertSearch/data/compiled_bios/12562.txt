Her background is in monogastric animal nutrition -poultry and swine. Her PhD research was about branched-chain amino acids requirements and metabolism in pig post weaning and characterization of metabolic profile of high performing pigs when were fed with optimum dietary branched-chain amino acid levels. The focus was to identify discriminating metabolites in blood or urine which could be linked to high growth performance. After conducting her PhD in Aarhus University in Denmark and prior to joining UQ, Dr Soumeh worked in animal feed industry (Cargill BV, Netherlands) for 2 years. During this time, Dr Soumeh was involved in different customer-focused research portfolios within the area of monogastric animal nutrition and production e.g. nutrient requirements and metabolism, gut health, nutritional strategies and management. Dr Soumeh has completed a BSc in Animal Science, MSc in Animal Nutrition and a PhD in Animal Nutrition and Physiology. The scientific outcomes have been published in high-impact journals and/or presented in conferences and symposiums around the world.
