The key topics include: experimental characterization of geomaterials under various stress and environmental conditions, micromechanical analysis of granular materials, constitutive modelling of geomaterials by considering inherent and induced anisotropy, multiscale modelling of geo-mechanical problems involving multi-physics such as hydraulic fracturing, ground thermal pumping and impact of climate change on geotechnical structures. His research also covers highway and railway geotechnics, particularly the effect of low-amplitude cyclic loading on soil behaviour. Education B.Sc., M.A.Sc.

CIV ENG 743 Fundamentals of Soil Behaviour Graduate 3 unit(s) P. Guo An understanding of soil behaviour is a fundamental requisite to a wide variety of geotechnical engineering applications, such as foundation design, soil-structure interaction and geotechnical earthquake engineering. Appropriate numerical modelling also highly depends on a better understanding of soil behaviour. This course, which focuses on the behaviour of soils under various conditions, their theoretical descriptions and laboratory testing, will provide students the knowledge and understanding of fundamental soil behaviour and of the underlying scientific principles.
