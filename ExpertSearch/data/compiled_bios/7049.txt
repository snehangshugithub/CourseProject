Laird Charles D. Laird Charles D. Laird Professor Emeritus cdlaird@u.washington.edu (206) 616-6267 Not accepting graduate students Fields of interest Cell and Molecular Biology, Development Research Biography Related news Relevant publications Our most recent work on epigenetics is facilitated by our development of three new methods that permit us to determine methylation patterns on both strands of individual DNA molecules (Laird et al., 2004). Charles is a Professor of Biology at the University of Washington, Associate Director for Fragile X Research in the University's Center on Human Development and Disability, and a faculty member in the Department of Genome Sciences. He received his BS from the University of Oregon, and his PhD from Stanford University. Charles was a faculty member at the University of Texas at Austin prior to joining the University of Washington in 1971. He has also taught or carried out research at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, the Zoology Institute of the University of Zurich, the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology (Cambridge), the Department of Genetics at Cambridge University, the Zoology Department at University of Bergen, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
