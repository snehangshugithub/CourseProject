My training spans many disciplines, with undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Spanish, and a Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction supported by a fellowship from the Institute of Education Sciences (IES). I have been named a Rising Star in EECS by MIT, a World Economic Forum Young Scientist, received the McCandless Chair and the Thomas and Lydia Moran Professorship in Learning Science, and been awarded the Jacobs Early Career Fellowship to study the use of educational technologies in emerging economies. I have been a visiting researcher at USCs Institute for Creative Technologies and the Pontificia Universidad Catlica de Chile, and have conducted field research on the deployment of educational technology across many international sites. My research (CV) is supported by the National Science Foundation, Google, the McDonnell Foundation, and the Jacobs Foundation.
