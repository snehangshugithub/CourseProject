In 2010, I received a degrees in math and physics from the University of Texas at San Antonio. In 2017, I received my PhD from the University of North Texas. After graduation, I worked at Dartmouth College during the 2017-2018 school year. My research consists of the geometric and algebraic connections between braid groups and reflection groups. I also study the geometric properties of complex reflection groups. During my free time, I like to listen to music and play the guitar. I enjoy math becauseI like thinking about abstract ideas and learning about the interconnections between fields. I enjoy the very specific thought process that is involving in deduction.
