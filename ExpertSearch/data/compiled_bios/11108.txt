Douglas)- The discovery of distinctively stringy nonperturbative effects in string theory, later understood to be caused by D-branes. These effects play a major role in string dynamics- The discovery of Matrix Theory, the first nonperturbative definition of String/M theory in a physical number of dimensions. Matrix Theory (see Matrix string theory) is an example of a gauge/gravity duality and is now understood to be a special case of the AdS/CFT correspondence (with Tom Banks, Willy Fischler and Leonard Susskind)- Basic results on the connection between quantum gravity and quantum chaos (with Douglas Stanford, Juan Maldacena and others) Academic Appointments Professor, Physics Administrative Appointments Asst--Full Professor, University of Chicago (1981 - 1989) Professor, Rutgers University (1989 - 1998) Professor, Stanford University (1998 - Present) Director, Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics (1998 - 2009) Honors & Awards Member, National Academy of Sciences (2015) Lars Onsager Prize, American Physical Society (2010) Dean's Award for Distinguished Achievements in Teaching, Stanford University (2007) Fellow, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2006) Fellow, American Physical Society (2003) Undergraduate Teaching Award, Rutgers Society of Physics Students (1992) Fellow, MacArthur Foundation (1987) Presidential Young Investigator Award, NSF (1985) Fellow, Sloan Foundation (1983) Professional Education Ph.D., Cornell University (1980) B.A., Harvard University (1975) Contact Academic sshenker@stanford.edu University - Faculty Department:&nbspPhysics Position:Professor VARIAN Stanford, California 94305-4060 (650) 723-4615 (office) (650) 723-4232 (office) (650) 723-9389 (fax) Administrative Contact Julie L Shih julie.shih@stanford.edu Additional Info Mail Code: 4060 Links Publications on INSPIRE Publications on arXiv Current Research and Scholarly Interests Professor Shenkers research focuses on quantum gravity, in particular string theory and M theory, with an emphasis on nonperturbative aspects. 2021-22 Courses Graduate Quantum Mechanics IPHYSICS 230 (Win) Independent Studies (2) Curricular Practical TrainingPHYSICS 291 (Aut) ResearchPHYSICS 490 (Aut, Win, Spr, Sum) Prior Year Courses 2020-21 Courses Advanced Theoretical Physics I: Random Matrices in PhysicsPHYSICS 450 (Aut) Graduate Quantum Mechanics IIPHYSICS 231 (Spr) 2019-20 Courses Graduate Quantum Mechanics IIPHYSICS 231 (Spr) Statistical MechanicsPHYSICS 212 (Aut) 2018-19 Courses Graduate Quantum Mechanics IIPHYSICS 231 (Spr) Statistical MechanicsPHYSICS 212 (Win) Stanford Advisees Doctoral Dissertation Reader (AC) Stanislav Fort, Brandon Rayhaun Postdoctoral Faculty Sponsor Yijian Zou Doctoral Dissertation Co-Advisor (AC) Shunyu Yao Doctoral (Program) Sam Cree, Alexander Frenkel, Bryen Irving, Kyung-Su Kim, Akshat Pandey, Nicholas Rapidis, Joshua Sandor, Samuel Wong, Michelle Xu, Kangning Yang, Kevin Zhou Report Accessibility Issues Powered By CAP Network Stanford University SU Home Maps & Directions Search Stanford Terms of Use Copyright Complaints Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305
