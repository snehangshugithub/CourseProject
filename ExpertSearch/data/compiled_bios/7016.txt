By bridging theories and methods across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, we seek to ask and answer questions that enhance our understanding of and capacity to manage the natural world. Our work combines fieldwork, modeling, and interdisciplinary approaches, centering on three themes: 1. Understanding the drivers of large-scale animal movements 2. Linking environmental processes and change to animal behavior, individual fitness, population persistence, and community dynamics 3. Applying spatial and behavioral ecology to inform wildlife management and conservation Briana Abrahms interviewed in UW News on climate change increasing human-wildlife conflict Briana Abrahms in UW News on Whale Safe project No publications found Main menu PeopleFacultyGraduate StudentsPostdocsStaffResearchGrad SpotlightFields of InterestUndergraduate OpportunitiesPrograms & CoursesUndergraduateAdmissionsAcademic ResourcesAdvisingAwards & ScholarshipsHonorsIntroductory CoursesInternshipsPeer facilitatorsRegistrationResearch OpportunitiesGraduateAwards & FellowshipsPh.D ProgramAdmissionsFAQGuidelinesLab RotationsFundingStudent LifeGrad TravelPostdoctoral FellowsPostdoc FAQRelated ProgramsUWINNeurobiologyCollege of the EnvironmentMicrobiologyCoursesFacilitiesLife Sciences ComplexGreenhouseResearchTeachingSupportContactResearchBackup FreezersImagingContactEquipmentInformationLocationPolicyRatesScheduleLearningBiology Study AreaTri-Beta AssistancePartnersBurke MuseumFriday Harbor LabsHerbariumNews & EventsCOVID-19 informationRecent NewsEventsSeminarsAutumnWinterSpringNewslettersBlogsMedicinal Herb GardenNature's DepthsSciPosAbout usSupport UW BiologyDiversity in BiologyDept Culture Office HourDiversity and Equity CommitteeResourcesJoin UW BiologyContact usDepartmental committeesMentoring resourcesVirtual tourLogin UW Home Directories Libraries Maps My UW 2016 University of Washington Department of Biology / Seattle, Washington /Privacy/ Terms of Use
