M.S., Mathematics, New York Universitys Courant Institute, USA, 1968. B.S., Engineering, University of Florida, USA, 1967. Research Interests My research is in computational neuroscience. I seek to understand the dynamics of neuronal systems, computations and behaviors. Current projects involve developing, analyzing and testing physiologically-based models for cellular integration and excitability, for auditory pathways of sound localization, for novelty detection and perception in multisource and ambiguous auditory scenes.
