More News My primary research interest is security in emerging environments. I am currently exploring topics such as secure machine learning in smart spaces and privacy in sensor-rich environments. If you want to meet with me outside of my office hours, email me to set up a time. Also include an agenda for the meeting. If you are interested in taking CSS497 with me, see my 497 Capstone Guidelines. For CSS595 or CSS700 see these MS Capstone Guidelines (MSCSSE or MSCSE). Contact me and begin this process as early as possible in order to have the best opportunity to succeed. I am currently looking for students at all levels to work with me on my research. Funding may be available for some projects. Send me an email (see contact information above) if you are interested. Do not include an unsolicited copy of your CV/Resume. I will ignore any emails with attachments. Do not ask me to help you get admitted to the program.
