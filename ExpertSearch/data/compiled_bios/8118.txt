We design materials to mimic soft tissues and whose properties can be modified at any location and time. These novel biomaterials are used as a flexible platform for cell culture to ask fundamental questions about how the environment surrounding a cell influences regeneration or disease progression. These findings are utilized to develop better strategies for tissue repair or disease treatment towards improving human health and quality of life.

These property changes are induced with user controlled triggers, such as light or enzymes. These materials enable the selective alteration of properties for applications of interest, such as dynamic cell culture, therapeutic delivery, and regenerative medicine. Understanding and directing complex tissue regeneration We seek to understand key microenvironment cues in tissue regeneration, especially tissue interfaces. We utilize responsive materials to control chemical and physical cues, such as cytokines, integrin-binding ECM mimics, and modulus, to examine their individual and synergistic effects on cell function. We subsequently translate these findings to improve regeneration strategies. Problems of interest include the regeneration of the bone-ligament interface for enhanced anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and of bone in patients with congenital or chronic disease. Examining matrix regulation of cell quiescence, activation, and fate in disease The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a critical role in regulating cell quiescence and activation in tissue homeostasis and repair. However, when misregulated, disease can be permitted or promoted. We are examining the role of the ECM and its remodeling in disease, especially in breast cancer cell dormancy and re-activation and fibrosis. Additionally, we are utilizing extracellular and intracellular cues to direct cell differentiation for the creation of improved disease models.
