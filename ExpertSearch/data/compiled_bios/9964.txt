I am currently a Senior Director at MediaTek USA since 2008. I am in charge of developing various CMOS RF SoC technologies and products for cellular (2G, 3G, 5G mmWave), Broadcast (TV tuners, FM) and connectivity (WiFi, BT, GPS/GNSS, NFC) resulting in a multi-billion dollar revenue with more than 20M units per month production shipments. Between 1995-2008, I held various IC design positions at Radio Comm. Corp., National Semiconductor, and Maxim Integrated Products, where I led many successful RF wireless designs for PCS, CDMA, WCDMA, WLAN and WiMax. In 2005, I was a visiting professor at the University of California Berkeley where I taught an advanced circuit design class for wireless communications. I currently serve on the Technical Program and Steering Committees for the IEEE RFIC Symposium. I am a former Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, a Guest Editor for the IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, and a Distinguished Lecturer for the IEEE Solid State Circuits Society. I am a senior IEEE member since 2003 and hold over 30 issued patents.
