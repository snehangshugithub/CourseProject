He obtained the Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Northeastern University in 1997, and worked for several years (from 1997 to 2004) as postdoctoral research associate at Northeastern, the University of Arizona and Arizona State University and as research professor at the Technological University of Panama. His research interests are broad and address problems in electromagnetic theory, mathematical physics, wave inversion and imaging theory, wireless communications and signal processing. He is a former Fulbright scholar sponsored by the USA Department of State, is a member of Phi Kappa Phi, Eta Kappa Nu, the IEEE, the American Physical Society and the Optical Society of America, and has been invited speaker at several universities in the USA and abroad.EducationPhD, Northeastern University, 1997Honors & AwardsNational Science Foundation CAREER Award Toggle Accordion Research Research OverviewTheoretical and applied electromagnetics, theoretical and applied optics, scattering theory, wave inverse problems, noniterative inverse scattering, physics-based signal processing and imaging, change detection theory and applications, compressive sensing, electromagnetic information theory, analysis and design of optical and quantum holographic detectorsCollege Research Initiatives Security, Sensing and Surveillance Systems link Department Research Areas Electromagnetics, Plasma, & Optics Toggle Accordion Publications Selected PublicationsE.A.
