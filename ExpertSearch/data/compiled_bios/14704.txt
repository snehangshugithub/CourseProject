Chemical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle WA - 2011 B.S. Chemical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette IN - 2008Research InterestsThe Richards laboratory seeks to quantify the relationships linking the microscopic structure of multicomponent materials to their macroscopic properties. We are interested in exploiting these relationships to develop new materials that facilitate the generation, storage and transport of electrical charge. These materials form the basis of emerging technologies that address challenges associated with the transition to a renewable energy driven infrastructure.Selected PublicationsHipp, Julie B.; Richards, Jeffrey J.; Wagner, Norman J., Direct measurements of the microstructural origin of shear-thinning in carbon black suspensions, Journal of Rheology 65(2):145-157.Chen, Jeffrey E.; Wang, Qifeng; Shull, Kenneth R.; Richards, Jeffrey J., Control over electroless plating of silver on silica nanoparticles with sodium citrate, Journal of Colloid And Interface Science 576:376-384.Richards, Jeffrey J.; Riley, John K., Dielectric RheoSANS, Current Opinion in Colloid and Interface Science 42:110-120.Hipp, Julie B.; Richards, Jeffrey J.; Wagner, Norman J., Structure-property relationships of sheared carbon black suspensions determined by simultaneous rheological and neutron scattering measurements, Journal of Rheology 63(3):423-436.Riley, John K.; Richards, Jeffrey J.; Wagner, Norman J.; Butler, Paul D., Branching and alignment in reverse worm-like micelles studied with simultaneous dielectric spectroscopy and RheoSANS, Soft Matter 14(26):5344-5355.Richards, Jeffrey J.; Hipp, Julie B.; Riley, John K.; Wagner, Norman J.; Butler, Paul D., Clustering and Percolation in Suspensions of Carbon Black, Langmuir 33(43):12260-12266.Richards, Jeffrey J.; Wagner, Norman J.; Butler, Paul D., A strain-controlled RheoSANS instrument for the measurement of the microstructural, electrical, and mechanical properties of soft materials, Review of Scientific Instruments 88(10).Lpez-Barrn, Carlos R.; Zeng, Yiming; Richards, Jeffrey J., Chain stretching and recoiling during startup and cessation of extensional flow of bidisperse polystyrene blends, Journal of Rheology 61(4):697-710.
