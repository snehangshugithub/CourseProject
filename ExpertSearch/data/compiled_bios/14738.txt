There are two main streams to his research: Developing economical ways of improving structural performance:this research identifies innovative ways of using traditional materials and construction methods to improve the resilience and sustainability of built infrastructure. There is a particular focus on developing self-centering steel seismic force resisting systems, such as controlled rocking steel braced frames. Developing appropriate structural modelling tools:this research enables more rational structural design and assessment through improved numerical modelling. While there is a particular focus on refined models that can simulate structural response up to collapse, simplified models are also being developed to provide design-level approximations of key response parameters. Embedded video for Lydell Education B.A.Sc (Toronto) M.Sc (ROSE School) Ph.D (Toronto) Biography Lydell Wiebe received his BASc (2005) and PhD (2013) in Civil Engineering from the University of Toronto, and his MSc in Earthquake Engineering from the ROSE School in Pavia, Italy (2008). He is an Associate Member of the Technical Committee for CSA S16 (Design of Steel Structures) and the Vice Chair of Working Group 9 (Seismic Design) for that Committee. He has received the GJ Jackson Fellowship Award (2005) and the HA Krentz Research Award (2015) from the Canadian Institute of Steel Construction. Dr. Wiebe is also the Secretary of the Canadian Association for Earthquake Engineering, and he led the writing of the New Zealand Design Guide for Controlled Rocking Steel Braced Frames. Dr. Wiebe has received numerous awards for his teaching, including the McMaster University Faculty of Engineering Teaching Excellence Award (2017) and the McMaster Students Union Award for Excellence in Teaching (2014, 2017).

CIV ENG 748 Seismic Design and Analysis of Steel Structures Graduate 3 unit(s) Prerequisite(s): 4N04 (Steel Structures) or equivalent; 730 (Earthquake Engineering) or equivalent Students will learn about the behaviour of steel seismic force resisting systems, such as moment-resisting frames, concentrically braced frames (with traditional or buckling-restrained braces), eccentrically braced frames, and self-centering systems. For each system, students will come to understand the associated provisions of the Canadian Steel Standard S16. In addition, students will develop experience with advanced numerical techniques for assessing the seismic performance of these systems, including nonlinear static and dynamic analysis.
