Im particularly interested in how we can improve the spatial and depth understanding of volume rendered medical data and studying the impact of augmented reality visualization for particular surgical tasks. Topics: Medical image visualization 3D perception Surgical tools& Image-guided surgery Human-computer interaction Publications **For up-to-date publication list please visit myGoogle Scholarpage** Selected Journal Papers S Drouin, A Kochanowska, M Kersten-Oertel, IJ Gerard, R Zelmann, D De Nigris, S Briault, T Arbel, D Sirhan, AF Sadikot, JA Hall, DS Sinclair, K Petrecca, RF DelMaestro, DL Collins DL.
