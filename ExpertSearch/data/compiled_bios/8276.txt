His modeling includes simulation of fluid flow, mass transport, heat transfer, solidification, deformation, and stress. By combining the results of his computational model calculations together with laboratory experiments, metallographic analysis, and measurements on operating commercial casters, he has generated fundamental knowledge about how the continuous casting process works, how defects form, and how quality can be improved. His research has quantified many of the phenomena which govern the continuous casting process, such as turbulent, multiphase fluid flow in the mold cavity, inclusion particle transport and entrapment, interfacial heat transfer and friction, distortion and crack formation. It has demonstrated the importance of mixing in both the tundish and strand during grade transitions when different grades of steel are cast sequentially, and has quantified the large difference between internal and surface compositions when strand mixing is important. This research has explained the mechanisms for how important microstructural features such as oscillation marks and subsurface hooks form during initial solidification at the meniscus. His favorite research activity is to compare the predictions of fundamentally-based models with experimental measurements. Examples in steel casters include fluid velocity and temperature in the liquid pool, surface level fluctuations, particle entrapment locations, breakout shell growth profiles under transient conditions, strand composition gradients due to grade intermixing, off-corner surface depression shapes, slab mold distortion, and crack locations.Prof. Thomas and his research group have developed several computational tools and new numerical methods for the analysis of metals processes such as continuous casting. This includes a fast user-friendly model of one-dimensional transient heat transfer in the slab-casting process (CON1D). A coupled, two-dimensional, transient finite-element model (CON2D) has been developed to predict temperature, shrinkage and stress development in both horizontal and vertical sections through the solidifying shell as it moves down through the caster. These models are being used to simulate and understand the formation of various defects, such as cracks that form due to non-uniform heat transfer during the early stages of solidification. The CON1D program has been implemented as a real-time software sensor into a fully-online control system (CONONLINE) to monitor temperature and solidification and to control spray-water cooling in the commercial thin-slab casting process. Prof. Thomas is the director of the Continuous Casting Consortium (CCC), a cooperative research effort to develop accurate computational models of the continuous casting process, and to apply them to solve practical problems of interest to the steel industry.
