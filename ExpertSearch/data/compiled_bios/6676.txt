Her research interests span computer vision and machine learning. Her current work focuses on developing statistical analysis methods for characterization of biological processes using images (from MRI to microscopy) as a source of information.She received BSc and Masters in Computer Science from Technion, Israel in 1993 and 1995, and a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT in 2001. She joined the faculty in 2003. degrees PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, MIT, 2001 MS in Computer Scince, Technion, Israel, 1995 BSc in Computer Science, Technion, Israel, 1993 selected awards/societies Henry Ellis Warren (1894) Chair in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, EECS, MIT, 2018 MICCAI Society Fellow. 2016 ECEDHA Diversity Award, 2014 Jamieson Prize for Excellence in Teaching, MIT, 2013 Smullin award for teaching excellence, EECS, MIT, 2011 research Polinasprimary research interest is in developing novel techniques for biomedical image analysis and understanding. She particularly enjoys working on algorithms that either explore the geometry of the world and the imaging process in a new way or improve image-based inference through statistical modeling of the image data. She isinterested in shape modeling and representation, predictive modeling, and visualization of statistical models. Polinascurrent research focuses on developing statistical analysis methods for characterization of biological processes using images as a source of information. In this domain, she is interested in modeling biological shape and function, how they relate to each other and vary across individuals. selected publications https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4GpKQUIAAAAJ&hl=en A full list of Professor Gollands publications can be foundon herwebsite.
