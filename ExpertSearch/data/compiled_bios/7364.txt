M.Sc., Statistics, University Paris-Sud Orsay, France, 1979. B.S., Mathematics, Ecole Normale Superieure (Paris), France, 1978. Research Interests My research is on probability theory (stochastic analysis, large deviations, random media and random matrices) and its connections with other domains of mathematics (partial differential equations, dynamical systems), physics (statistical mechanics of disordered media), and industrial applications. My main interest is in the time evolution of complex systems, and the universal aspects of their long time behavior and of their slow relaxation to equilibrium, in particular how complexity and disorder imply aging.
