He holds a PhD in Operations Research from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a BS in Industrial Engineering from Tsinghua University.Before joining UW, hewas a postdoctoral researcher and a senior data scientist at Uber's marketplace group. Education Ph.D. Operations Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2017 B.S. Industrial Engineering, Tsinghua University, 2012 Research Statement Dr. Yan's research centers around transportation and logistics systems, with a recent focus on emerging problems in sharing economy and online platforms. He also has a particular interest in air transportation systems.His work aims to study fundamental properties of these problems and propose (data-driven) practical solutions for implementation. When analyzing these problems, he is broadly interested in tools from optimization, game theory, stochastic modeling and statistics.Dr. Yan is a recipient of the Best Dissertation Award Honorable Mention and the Outstanding Paper Award in Air Transportation from INFORMS Transportation Science and Logistics Society, the Best Dissertation Award from INFORMS Aviation Application Section, and the AGIFORS Anna Valicek Award of Airline Operations Research, among others.Before joining UW, hewas a postdoctoral researcher and a senior data scientist at Uber's marketplace groupwhere he designed the current version of rider surge pricingalgorithm which balances demand and supply in real-time.
