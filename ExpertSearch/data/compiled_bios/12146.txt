His research group studies optoelectronic materials that are suitable for the mass production of electronics using printing technologies. There is an emphasis on the development of printable electronic materials (polymers and nanomaterials) used in thin film transistors (for flexible displays, smart labels, chemo-/bio-sensors, themoelectrics, and memory devices), photovoltaics (for solar cells and photodetectors), and batteries. Professor Li has been the co-recipient of several awards including the 3rd Annual national Aeronautics and Space administration (NASA) Nanotech Briefs Nano 50 Awards for Printed Organic Electronics in the Technologies category in 2007. So far he has authored over 150 articles in peer-reviewed journals. Professor Li has filed over 120 US patent applications with 74 granted.Research InterestsOrganic and polymer semiconductorsOrganic thin film transistorsOrganic solar cellsOrganic photovoltaicsPrinted electronicsPrintable conductive inksPolymer synthesisNanomaterialsElectronic materialsPolymer solar cellsPolymer bulk-heterojunction photovoltaicsSmall molecule-based OPVDye-sensitized Solar CellsOrganic Light-Emitting DiodesChemical/biosensors and photo-detectorsLow Temperature-processable Conductive inksFabrications and Characterization of Organic ElectronicsInternet of Things (IoT)NanotechnologyEducation1999, Doctorate, Polymer materials, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology1988, Master's, Polymer materials, Dalian University of Technology1985, Bachelor's, Polymer materials, Dalian University of TechnologyCourses*CHE 102 - Chemistry for EngineersTaught in 2018CHE 241 - Materials Science and EngTaught in 2020, 2021CHE 330 - Chemical Eng ThermodynamicsTaught in 2021CHE 640 - Principles of Polymer ScienceTaught in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021CHE 745 - Res.
