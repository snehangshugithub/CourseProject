I hold a leadership role in large multi-institutional partnerships encompassing world-leading Australian and US universities, supercomputing facilities, and IT corporations.I am the leader of one of the Pawsey Centre for Extreme-scale Computing (PaCER) projects, a partner investigators for one of the Australasian Leadership Computing Grant, and the lead ofGPU development for theGAMESS Exascale Computing Project. In 2020 and 2021, using my algorithms on the fastest supercomputer on the planet, I broke the world record for the largest computational-driven chemical modellings of material structure, setting new standards in High-Performance Computing, and enabling the design of ground-breaking materials, catalysts, and drugs. More information can be found on my group website. Research My passionis the development of high-performance algorithmsand software artefactsthat usecutting-edge HPC machines, such as exascale supercomputers, to push the boundaries of what is currently achievable in computational science. My research agenda also focuses ondevising transformative digital technologies that use HPC and AI to augment or replace R&D and manufacturing physical trial-and-error, minimizing time, costs and pollution of the entire lifecycle of industrial and research activities.

Concerning PhD positions, at the moment fully funded scholarships are available as well as top-up scholarshipsbased on merit. If you are interested in joining my group,pleaseread thefollowing guidelinesto express your interest. First, familiarise either with theANU requirements for Honours entryor with theANU requirements for PhD/MPhil entry. If you are an ANUundergraduate or masters' student interested in Honours,Ihave various existing projects ideas in HPC and computational science: please refertostudent projects tab on this page to confirmyour interest inmyresearch.Projects are not limited to the ones listed on thestudent projects tab:As long as it aligns withmyresearch directions,I amalso happy for you to propose your own project. Therefore,email meto express your interest,including background information (e.g., courses taken, academic transcript, and programming skills) and a concise statement about the research that you would like to undertake. If you are a prospectivePhD student:I expect youtohaveexcellent programming and mathematicalskills, preferably withsomeprior experience in scientific computationand/or HPC. You should havegoodEnglish proficiency, strong programming skills in C/C++, some familiarity with MPI, OpenMP and/or CUDA, and withversioncontrol (GitHub or SVN). If you meet theserequirements, email meto express your interest! How to apply for a PhD position: After reading paragraph 3,write your email with care, avoiding carelessness or obvious mistakes. Include in the emailbackground information (e.g., courses taken, academic transcript, and programming skills) and a concise statementabout your motivation to undertake a PhD under my supervision. Based on your email, I will decide whether we can proceed with an interview. Postdoctoral openings I am looking for a Postdoctoral Research Fellow to join my group in High-Performance Computing at ANU. Please visit the job advert https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2645647427/ on LinkedIn and/or email me for more information. I am the convener of the COMP3320/6464 course on High Performance Scientific Computationhttps://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2021/course/comp3320 My group works onthe development of algorithmsand software artefactsthat leverage high-performance computing and AI and run oncutting-edge HPC machines, such as exascale supercomputers, to push the boundaries of what is currently achievable in computational science and innovation. My ambition is to integrate HPC, Big Data, AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) with STEM to enable transformative digital technologies that can augment or replace physical trial-and-error involved in R&D and monitoring of manufacturing operations, accelerating and rendering cheaper and more sustainable the entire lifecycle of industrial and research activities. Targeting the algorithms that underpin computational science software, the research in my group impacts a broad spectrum of application areas. Current application foci include artificial intelligence and machine learning, computational chemistry, material science, bioinformatics and applied mathematics.
