Nozick Professor Civil and Environmental Engineering Hollister Hall, Room 323 607/255-6496 Director of Civil and Environmental Engineering lkn3@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyDr. Linda Nozick is Professor and Director of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University. She is a past Director of the College Program in Systems Engineering, a program she co-founded. She has been the recipient of several awards including a CAREER award from the National Science Foundation and a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers from President Clinton for "the development of innovative solutions to problems associated with the transportation of hazardous waste." She has authored over 60 peer-reviewed publications, many focused on transportation, the movement of hazardous materials and the modeling of critical infrastructure systems. She has been an associate editor for Naval Research Logistics and a member of the editorial board of Transportation Research Part A. She has served on two National Academy Committees to advise the US Department of Energy on renewal of their infrastructure. During the 1998-1999 academic year she was a Visiting Associate Professor in the Operations Research Department at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Dr. Nozick holds a B.S. in Systems Analysis and Engineering from the George Washington University and a M.S.E and Ph.D. in Systems Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania.Research InterestsDr. Nozick's primary research interest is the development of mathematical models for use in the management of complex systems. She has particular interest in systems that can be represented mathematically as networks, including transportation and logistics systems, civil infrastructure networks and project networks.AlgorithmsComplex Systems, Network Science and ComputationNatural HazardsEnergy and the EnvironmentData MiningScientific ComputingStatistics and Machine LearningSystems and Networking TransportationTransportation Systems EngineeringTeaching InterestsNetwork modeling for transportation planning.Service InterestsI serve on the Strategic Oversight Committee for the College of Engineering.
