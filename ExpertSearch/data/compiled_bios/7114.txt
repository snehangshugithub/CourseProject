Major focus is placed on biological control of insect pests, host plant resistance, least dose pesticide usage when required and insect long-ranged migration. These foci are supported with active research projects with the biological control of alfalfa snout beetle, breeding for snout beetle resistant alfalfa (with Don Viands), least dose evaluations with corn rootworm and potato leafhopper and long-ranged movement of potato leafhopper and soybean aphid. Additional foci on aerobiology include joint projects with the movement of corn pollen (D. Aylor, CT Ag Exp. Stat.), movement of wheat head scab (G. Bergstrom) and dispersal of herbicide resistant weed seed ( D. Mortensen, Penn State). Research information is disseminated to the agribusiness audience using extension articles, extension presentations, and interviews with the popular press. With field crops grown in every county in NYS and the field crop commodity planted in over 90% on NYS agricultural land, the audience is large and diverseResearch FocusThe focus of my extension and research efforts is to reduce the environmental impact of insect management in field crops utilizing the guidelines of IPM (Integrated Pest Management).
