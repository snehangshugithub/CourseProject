D. 04) became a victim of the Mexican governments decision to devalue the peso against the U.S. dollar in 1994. The tequila effect that this action had on the South American economy was the prime reason Terech left consulting and took advantage of a full EMBA scholarship at IAE Business School, Universidad Austral in Buenos Aires, before receiving a second scholarship to earn a Ph.D. at UCLA Anderson in 2004. He began his academic career as an IAE faculty member in 1997, teaching MBA students and executive programs. After he received his Ph.D., Terech traded southern hemisphere summers for winters, traveling north to the U.S. to teach elective courses and conduct research as a visiting professor at UCLA Anderson. He later became a full-time adjunct associate professor of marketing in 2009. Its not surprising that Terechs strongest area of research is in retailing and includes modeling consumer choice behavior and competitive market structure. I grew up in the retail environment, as my family had two stores in a town north of Buenos Aires, he says. His consulting experience covers several marketing challenges, such as new product launches, marketing plans and growth strategies, promotion and communication programs, distribution strategy, pricing and sales promotions, and feasibility analysis. He has advised startups and Fortune 500 clients in a variety of industries, including retailing, agribusiness, financial services, textile and automobile, and sits on the advisory boards of several start-up companies. Terechs current work focuses on studying the integration of different methods of shopping available to consumersand retailers performance metrics. He takes a special interest in marketing issues related to branding, pricing, franchising and retailing evident in the Latin American Franchising Research Council (CLIF) he founded in 2007 in Argentina, which brought together academics and franchisors to help promote intellectual leadership in franchising. He teaches courses in pricing, marketing strategy, marketing analysis and frameworks, retail management, and sales force and distribution channel strategy. He has also taught executive seminars at different business schools in Spain, Mexico, Chile, Peru, and Ecuador. He enjoys writing cases for publications, describing it as the ideal way to connect theory and practice, to provide real context to frameworks and theories. Much of his work has been published in scholarly journals and specialized business publications, such as Case Research Journal, Marketing Letters and Harvard Business Review. When not focusing on his research, Terech can be found occasionally on a basketball court, coaching soccer and baseball, or taking the family on yearly camping trips.
