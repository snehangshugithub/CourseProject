Kientz CV Adjunct Professor jkientz@uw.edu 206-221-0614 Sieg Hall 423C Website Fax: 206-616-3152 Specializations Biomedical and Health Informatics Human-Computer Interaction User-Centered Design Biography Julie A. Kientz is an Assistant Professor in the department of Human Centered Design & Engineering and an Adjunct Professor in The Information School and Computer Science & Engineering. She is also director of the Computing for Healthy Living and Learning Lab and is active in the Design, Use, Build (dub) alliance. Dr. Kientz's primary research areas are in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction, Ubiquitous Computing, and Health Informatics. Dr. Kientz's research focuses on understanding and reducing the user burdens of interactive technologies for health through the design of future applications. She has design, developed, and evaluated mobile, sensor, and social applications for helping individuals with sleep disorders, assisting parents of young children in tracking developmental progress, assisting individuals with visual impairments, helping people quit smoking, and assisting special education teachers working with children with autism. Her primary research methods involve human-centered design, technology development, and a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. Dr. Kientz received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2008, under the advisement of Gregory Abowd, and her B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of Toledo in 2002. She was awarded a National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2009, named her department's Junior Faculty Innovator in 2012, and named an MIT Technology Review Innovator Under 35 in 2013.
