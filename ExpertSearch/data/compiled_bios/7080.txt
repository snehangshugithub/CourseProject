I work on all aspects of speech recognition first and foremost turning speech into text, but also analyzing personality or other paralinguistic properties, and including interactive systems in the medical or non-medical domain. I have recently performed work on large-scale multimedia analysis, extracting sound features and generating textual summaries of large-scale consumer-generated multimedia databases.
