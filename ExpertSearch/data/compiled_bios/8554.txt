She was an Assistant investigator at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute before returning to UW as an Associate Professor. As Co-Director of Clinical Informatics and Patient-Centered Technologies (CIPCT), a joint MS program between the UW School of Nursing and the Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education, she oversees program development, curriculum, and teaches and advises students. Dr. Hartzler also serves in a leadership role operationally for UW Medicine to provide clinical informatics expertise and leads patient experience initiatives. She has served on multiple national committees for the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA), and others. She enjoys dancing and is a volunteer ski instructor. Research: Dr. Hartzler is passionate about collaborative technologies that empower people to lead healthy lives through interaction with expert peer networks and health professionals. Grounded in human-centered design of digital health innovations, her research spans health informatics and human-computer interaction. She integrates social computing, interaction design, and patient-generated data to facilitate peer support and enhance patient-provider relationships. Examples include systems to support personal health information management, visual display of patient-reported outcomes, and patient matching for peer mentoring. Her research has been recognized through multiple best paper awards. She has led and contributed to research projects funded by National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Google, and others. Most recently, she was awarded an R01 grant from the National Library of Medicine to address implicit bias in communication between patients and providers through automated sensing and feedback technology.
