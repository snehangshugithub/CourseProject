Background: Working 1/2 time as a Hospitalist at Virginia Mason Medical Center and 1/2 time as the Chief Medical Informatics Officer at Virginia Mason. Completed in 2009 National Library of Medicine Post-Doctoral Fellowship within BHI. During fellowship completed a clinical trial of an EHR based tool to assist the UWMC and HMC Rapid Response Teams proactively identify deteriorating patients outside the intensive care units in an effort to reduce mortality, unexpected cardiac arrest and unexpected transfers to the intensive care units. Research: Collaborating with Dr. Wanda Pratt from the iSchool on an AHRQ grant titled Patients as Safeguards. Through this grant we are studying what the information needs are for adults at Virginia Mason Medical Center and children and their caregivers at Seattle Childrens Hospital so that they can play a role in safeguarding their own care.
