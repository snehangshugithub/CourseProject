She was awarded the American Heart Association postdoctoral fellowship and right after graduation, she completed her postdoctoral training at the Ohio State University and at Georgia Institute of Technology. Her research focuses on tackling the complexity of: (a) structural heart biomechanics (adult and congenital); (b) patient-specific cardiovascular model development and in-vitro testing; (c) prosthetic heart valve engineering (surgical and transcatheter); (d) structure-function relationships of the heart in health and disease at the pediatric and adult stages; and (e) turbulence in blood flow in relation to blood damage. Dr. Hatoum has published in multiple journals spanning both clinical and bioengineering sides and given oral and poster presentations at national and international conferences. She has received several recognitions including the Presidential Graduate Fellowship from OSU, an invited talk at the Heart Valve Society, the best paper award from the Annals of Biomedical Engineering and she was a finalist in the American College of Cardiology Young Investigator Award 2021. Biofluids Laboratory Trainees Health Research Institute The Biofluids Lab is at the heart of engineering and clinical research. We utilize novel technologies to solve clinical problems, and we benefit from diverse collaborative efforts on the biomaterials, manufacturing, clinical, and translational sides.
