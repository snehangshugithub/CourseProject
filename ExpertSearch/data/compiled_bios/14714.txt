Electronics from the University of Kashan, Iran, and his MS from the University of Bologna, and will be working on satellite-aircraft networking. Mr. Hollis (Eddie) King, Ph.D. Student Mr. Jinwen Liu, Ph.D. Student Jinwen received his BSEE degree in 2013 from Beijing Institute of Technology, China, and his MSEE degree from Syracuse University in 2015. He worked as a product test engineer at China Mobile Research Institute. He joined the WSEL in January 2015, and has begun work on K-band satellite channel modeling. Mr. Mohsen Mohanad, Ph.D. Student Mohsen received his B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Basrah University, Iraq, in 2004, and his MS degree from Brunel University, UK, in 2010. He spent several years working in Iraq at Furatphone, on CDMA technology. He joined the WSEL in 2014. His research involves multi-antenna modeling and processing for 5th generation wireless systems.Mohanad Mohsen successfully defended his Ph.D. dissertation, entitled "30 GHz Path Loss Modeling and Performance Evaluation for Non-coherent M-ary Frequency Shift Keying in the 30 GHz Band" in December 2019. Mr. Mohsen will make final revisions to this dissertation and plan to graduate in Spring 2020. Harold (Ken) McGill, MS Student Post - Docs Dr. Hosseinali Jamal, Ph.D., 2017 Hossein received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tafresh University, Iran, in 2009, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shahid Beheshti University, Iran, in 2012. After work at SBU as a research assistant, in 2013 he became an RA with the WSEL here at USC. His research involves novel waveform designs for air-ground communications, wireless channel modeling fof UAVs, and software-defined radio. Hes the author/co-author of two conference papers and one journal paper in review. Dr. Mustafa Cenk Erturk Alumni Mr. Patrick Murphy, MS,2019 Patrick received his BS from USC in 2016, and he workedon configuring a satellite earth station to measure atmospheric effects on K band satellite systems.
