There is a significant emphasis on developing advanced computational techniques in order to accurately model these structures from first principles. We are also actively exploring the device applications of nanophotonic structures, with areas of interest including information and energy technologies. Condensed Matter Physics Some of the theoretical and computational techniques are directly borrowed from condensed matter theory. The applications of these techniques into photonics area also deepen one's understanding of many of the issues in theoretical and computational condensed matter physics.
