Fox and Dorothea Doctors Fox Associate Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Associate Professor of Neuroscience Overview Dr. Asaad is Director of Functional and Epilepsy Neurosurgery at Rhode Island Hospital. His research work focuses on neurophysiology and neuromodulation in both human and animal subjects. Dr. Asaad received his undergraduate degree from Amherst College, and then earned a PhD in Systems Neuroscience from MIT, followed by an MD from Yale University. He completed a general surgery internship and neurosurgical residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital / Harvard Medical School. He joined Brown University in 2011. His lab seeks to improve our understanding of the basic neural circuit mechanisms of learning, memory and decision-making, and to apply this knowledge to alleviate the cognitive, affective,and motor sequelae of human neurological illness and injury. His clinical interests include functional neurosurgery (including deep brain stimulation), epilepsy surgery, psychiatric neurosurgery, and traumatic brain injury.

Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview Our lab is interested in how the frontal cortex and basal ganglia work together to enable rapid learning and highly-contingent decision making, as well as their contributions to neurologic and psychiatric diseases. Our methods involve multi-electrode neuronal recordings as well as neurostimulation in human and nonhuman subjects, in both the operative and laboratory settings. We aim to advance neuromodulation by improving our understanding of the neurophysiological and behavioral biomarkers of disease. We're also interested in developing circuit-based, neuromodulation methods to foster or augment learning to improve recovery from neurologic illness or injury.
