In doing so, he hopes to provide insight into the functions and dysfunctions of neural and cardiac systems. He combines mathematical analysis of idealized models with numerical simulations of more biophysically realistic models. The idealized models help to uncover the basic mechanisms underlying the dynamical behavior of physiological systems, whereas the biophysical models allow for direct comparison to experimental data. Collaboration with experimentalists is an essential part of his work.Selected Publications Zhang C, Guy RD, Mulloney B, Zhang Q, and Lewis TJ.
