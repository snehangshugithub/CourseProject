Her research fields involve using ultraviolet reactors as an alternative technology to prevent contamination incidents in the biopharmaceutical industry and the development of enzymatic packed bed reactors for biodiesel production. She holds a computing technology degree along with her chemical engineering degrees, and enjoys using computer software to solve chemical engineering problems.Research InterestsUltraviolet irradiationBiopharmaceutical sterilizationEnzymatic packed-bed reactorsBiocatalytic biodiesel productionSol-gel enzyme immobilizationPhotocatalysisEducation2013, Doctorate, Chemical Engineering, University of Waterloo2006, Master of Applied Science, Chemical Engineering, University of Ottawa2004, Bachelor of Science (BSc), Computing Technology, University of Ottawa2004, Bachelor of Applied Science, Chemical Engineering, University of OttawaCourses*CHE 101 - Chemical Eng'g Concepts 2Taught in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021CHE 102 - Chemistry for EngineersTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020CHE 322 - Num Methd Process Anls DesgnTaught in 2018, 2019CHE 361 - Bioprocess EngineeringTaught in 2019CHE 480 - Process Analysis and DesignTaught in 2018, 2019, 2020* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsMichelle A Gabriel, Emma V Dare, Sarah M Meunier, J Larry Campbell, Michael R Sasges, Marc G Aucoin, Ultraviolet irradiation of trypsin, lysozyme and -galactosidase: how does UVC affect these enzymes when used as a secondary barrier against adventitious agents?, Vaccine, 37(43), 2019, 6518 - 6525Sarah M Meunier, Michael R Sasges, Marc G Aucoin, Evaluating ultraviolet sensitivity of adventitious agents in biopharmaceutical manufacturing, Journal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology, 2017Sarah M Meunier, Biljana Todorovic, Emma V Dare, Afroza Begum, Simon Guillemette, Andrew Wenger, Priyanka Saxena, J Larry Campbell, Michael Sasges, Marc G Aucoin, Impact of dissolved oxygen during UV-irradiation on the chemical composition and function of CHO cell culture media, PloS one, 2016Sarah M Meunier, Amin R Rajabzadeh, Trevor G Williams, Raymond L Legge, Methyl Oleate Production in a Supported SolGel Immobilized Lipase Packed Bed Reactor, Energy & Fuels, 2015Sarah M Meunier, Amin R Rajabzadeh, Raymond L Legge, Kinetic modelling of the production of methyl oleate by Celite supported lipase solgels, Biochemical engineering journal, 2014Sarah M Meunier, Raymond L Legge, Study of support materials for sol-gel immobilized lipase, Biocatalysis and Biotransformation, 2013Sarah M Meunier, Raymond L Legge, Evaluation of diatomaceous earth supported lipase solgels as a medium for enzymatic transesterification of biodiesel, Journal of Molecular Catalysis B: Enzymatic, 2012Sarah M Meunier, Raymond L Legge, Evaluation of diatomaceous earth as a support for solgel immobilized lipase for transesterification, Journal of Molecular Catalysis B: Enzymatic, 2010Sarah M Meunier, Joanne Gamage, Zdravko Duvnjak, Zisheng Zhang, Design and characterization of a novel rotating corrugated drum reactor for wastewater treatment, International Journal of Photoenergy, 2010Sarah M Meunier, Hamid-Reza Kariminia, Raymond L Legge, Immobilized enzyme technology for biodiesel production, Advances in biofeedstocks and biofuels: Production technologies for biofuels, TOP Share University of Waterloo Engineering 6(E6) Phone:519-888-4567 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Chemical Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright News Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
