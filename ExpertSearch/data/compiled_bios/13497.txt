He is an expert on Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer, Optics, and Modelling of Energy Systems. He holds a Doctoral Degree in Industrial Engineering for the University of Seville (Spain) and a Doctor of Philosophy Degree in Applied Physics for the University of Massachusetts Lovell, (USA). Since September 2016, he is Full Professor and European Research Area (ERA) Chair in Solar Thermal Technologies for the Eastern Mediterranean of the Energy Division of the Cyprus Institutes Energy, Environment and Water Research Centre (EEWRC) - one of the few selected ERA Chairs awarded by the European Commission across Europe. He is currently Vice-Chair of SolarPACES, the Technology Collaboration Programme of the International Energy Agency responsible for promoting the development and deployment of solar thermal power technologies and the solar-assisted manufacture of fuels and chemicals, and was Chair of SolarPACES from September 2011 to September 2017. Until August 2016, he was Science Leader of the Solar Energy Systems Research Group of CSIRO - Australias National Research Agency, and Director of the Australian Solar Thermal Research Initiative (ASTRI), an eight-year eighty seven million dollars research program targeted to increase the cost-competitiveness of CST technologies and enhance the international positioning of Australia in these technologies. In addition to CSIRO, the development of ASTRI involves six Australian universities and the collaboration of several US National Laboratories and universities. He is former Director of the Solar Thermal Energy Department of the National Renewable Energy Centre of Spain (CENER); Chair and Full Professor of the Engineering Department of the University of Texas at Brownsville; and Director of the Plataforma Solar de Almera of CIEMAT, the worlds largest solar research infrastructure. He participated in the studies and in the decision-making process that culminated in the regulation of the Feed-In-Tariffs for renewable energy technologies in Spain, and participated as a consultant for the World Bank in Feed-In-Tariff and in studies of the economic impact of CST technologies in India. He has also participated in over 23 techno-economic feasibility studies of CST power plant projects in Spain and directed a detailed feasibility study of a 200 MW CST power plant in Botswana sponsored by the World Bank. He is the author of numerous scientific publications, and participates, in a senior capacity, in a large number of national and international expert groups and committees.
