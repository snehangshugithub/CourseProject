To build better solar cells, we need to elucidate how the local chemical environment impacts charge carrier generation and transport. For the next generation of interfaces between digital electronics and biology, we need to uncover how ions and electrons navigate through heterogeneous polymers. Elucidating these dynamic processes and linking them to device performance is challenging because of the wide range of length and time scales involved. The primary goal of the Bischak Lab is to elucidate dynamic processes in materials to provide new design principles for devices. To achieve this goal, the Bischak Lab develops new methods to interrogate structural transformations in soft materials, track electronic and ionic transport through complex energy landscapes, and capture nanoscale dynamics at liquid-solid interfaces. Group members will become proficient in a variety of in situ and in operando materials characterization methods, the development of state-of-the-art nanoscale imaging platforms, and the design and implementation of advanced quantitative image analysis pipelines.
