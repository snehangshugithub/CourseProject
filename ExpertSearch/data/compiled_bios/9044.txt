Prior to joining Northeastern in August 2021, he was a Principal Research Scientist at the Center for Organic Photonics and Electronics and the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. His past research included multiple areas of physical optics and photonics, investigations of the physical properties of organic semiconductors, and the physics and engineering of microelectronic and optoelectronic organic semiconductor devices, including organic thin-film transistors, organic photovoltaics, organic photodetectors, high energy density capacitors, and organic light-emitting diodes. They also included encapsulation, reliability, and sustainability of organic devices and their applications.His current research interests lie at the intersection between electrical and computer engineering, mechanical engineering, and material science. They include novel flexible and stretchable sensors capable of autonomous operation and fabricated using high throughput manufacturing methods. His goal is to enable low-cost multimodal sensing surfaces that operate at a local level or as part of a wireless network infrastructure to create new ways for users to interact with the living environment and in areas that support global-scale applications ranging from healthcare to smart agriculture and large scale sensing.Dr. Fuentes-Hernandez received a BS in physics from the Universidad Nacional Autonma de Mxico in 1998. He received a PhD from the Optical Sciences Center at the University of Arizona in 2004. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the Georgia Institute of Technology from 2005 to 2007 and a research faculty from 2007 to 2021.EducationPhD, Optical Sciences, University of Arizona, 2004 Toggle Accordion Research Research OverviewFlexible and stretchable organic microelectronics and optoelectronics, device physics and engineering for sensing and energy generation, high throughput manufacturing and heterogeneous integrationDepartment Research Areas Microsystems, Materials & Devices Toggle Accordion Publications Selected PublicationsFuentes-Hernandez, C., Chou, W.-F., Khan, T.M., Diniz, L., Lukens, J., Larrain, F.A., Rodriguez-Toro, V., Chang, Y.-C., Kippelen, B.
