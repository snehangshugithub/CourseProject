Prior to joining the faculty of Harvard Medical School, he was a Research Scientist at MIT. He has published over 230 manuscripts that have collectively accumulated over 53,000 citations, reflecting an h-index of 67 (Web of Science) and 106 (Google Scholar). Dr. Boumas research has led to over 300 issued/allowed patents, with over 100 additional patent applications pending. Many of his patents have been licensed to four different companies, resulting in 5 distinct medical devices on the market. In addition, he serves on the scientific advisory boards of several companies. Degrees Ph.D. in Physics, University of Illinois at Chicago M.S. in Physics, Michigan State University B.S. in Physics, Hope College selected awards/societies Fellow, Optical Society of America, 2007 Edward M. Kennedy Award for Health Care Innovation, 2004 Research Interests My research has focused on novel technologies for disease diagnosis and treatment and has spanned from early innovation through development and validation and into clinical applications. Instruments that I have invented and developed have been applied in clinical studies of cervical cancer, bladder cancer, coronary atherosclerosis, laryngeal pathology, dermatologic lesions, colonic and esophageal cancer, and diseases of the common bile duct and pancreas. Since my years as a post-doctoral fellow and research scientist at MIT, I have focused a sustained effort toward the development of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and I am internationally recognized for important contributions that have made this technology a clinical reality. My specific contributions in this area include the invention of many of the core component technologies that are now in widespread use, the first clinical demonstrations of OCT in numerous clinical applications, and the validation of OCT protocols for, in particular, the diagnosis of esophageal cancer and its precursors and the detection and characterization of coronary artery pathology.
