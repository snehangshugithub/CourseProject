She holds a BASc from the University of Waterloo, a MASc from Thomas Jefferson University, and a PhD from the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Kim is primarily interested in studying human-building interactions and the role of technologies to augment occupant performance and building energy efficiency. Her research leverages IoT and data-driven analytics to predict human comfort and behaviour, personalize occupant experience in the built environment and enable intelligent building design and operation. Her research interests also include smart grid technologies and utility cost optimizations.Research InterestsIntelligent building design and operationHuman-building interactionOccupant comfort, behaviour, and productivityIndoor environment qualitiesInternet of ThingsMachine learning/Artificial IntelligenceEnergy efficiency Smart gridDemand responseEducation2018, Doctorate, Architecture (Building Science), University of California, Berkeley2011, Master of Science, Sustainable Design, Thomas Jefferson University2006, Bachelor of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, University of WaterlooCourses*AE 225 - Environmental Building StudioTaught in 2020CIVE 105 - Mechanics 2Taught in 2020, 2021* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsKim, J., Bauman, F., Raftery, P., Arens, E., Zhang, H., Fierro, G., ... & Culler, D.
