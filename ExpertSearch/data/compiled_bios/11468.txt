Current R&D activities are geared toward the development of surface modification techniques and processes, characterization of thin film properties, tribology, ceramic composites, and transparent optical ceramics (TOC) for scintillators. Professor Sarin has established and developed several material research laboratories for education, training and research. These include a state-of-the-art Surface Modification Laboratory with research activities focused in the areas of high temperature, and tribological CVD, PVD, and diamond coatings. Emphasis on structure-property correlations of thin films has resulted in the development of innovative methodologies and new equipment. Development of consolidation techniques of composite ceramics and TOCs has lead to several unique patented processes and materials. He has published over a hundred technical papers, has been the principal editor of more than ten books, and holds more than eighty patents. Severed as visiting professor at several International Universities, and been a consultant to several multinational organizations.
