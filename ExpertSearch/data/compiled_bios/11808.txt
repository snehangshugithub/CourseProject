He joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Hawaii, Manoa (UHM) in 2019 as an Assistant Professor. Prior to joining UHM, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Mathematics, Purdue University, and a Research Fellow in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the University of Michigan, from 2015-2016 and 2016-2019, respectively. My research interests in data science include machine learning & AI (e.g., self-supervised learning, iterative neural networks, and sparse representation learning),optimization (e.g., non-convex optimization, block optimization, and proximal gradient methods), and compressed sensing (e.g., multi-imager/sensor system and sampling optimization), with current and past projects in imaging, image processing, and computer vision: medical imaging (e.g., X-ray CT, MRI, PET, and SPECT), computational photography (e.g., light-field photography, depth estimation, and 3D object tracking), vision-based autonomous systems (e.g., end-to-end autonomous driving, visual SLAM, inter-vehicle distance estimation, anomaly detection using drone imaging), andbiomedical image computing (e.g., abnormality detection on brain images and microscopic image segmentation). I am interested both in developing computational data science solutions to these problems, as well as improving fundamental understanding of these solutions. For a snapshot of our current research, see recent preprints/submitted papers under the "publications" link on the left-hand menu and available projects under the ECE'sBME and SDSresearch links. I have been teaching the following imaging and data science courses at UHM: EE416: Introduction to Image Processing and Computer Vision (F19, F20), and EE616: Computational Image Processing and Computer Vision (S20, S21).
