The many proteins with which tRNAs interact during protein synthesis make them excellent systems for investigating specific RNA-protein interactions. He examined tRNA structure, function and biosynthesis using biochemistry, genetics and in vivo functional analyses. Uttam RajBhandary is no longer accepting students.
