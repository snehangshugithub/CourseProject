Prof. Fohtung is an expert in scattering and imaging techniques for nanoscale device materials, with a focus on ferroic nanostructures where charge, spin, lattice and orbital degree of freedom compete to create novel topological configurations of electric and magnetic polarization. After a Ph.D. in materials science and physics from the University of Freiburg, Germany and a postdoctoral fellowship in UC San Diego, he was a LANSCE Associate Professor of physics and materials at New Mexico State Univ. and Los Alamos National Laboratory prior to joining Rensselaer. Prof. Fohtung is a recipient of numerous awards including the Rosen Fellow at LANL and the LINX (Lund Institute of Advanced Neutron and X-ray Science) fellowship in Sweden.
