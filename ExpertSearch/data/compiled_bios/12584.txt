Edward graduated with a Ph.D. degree in Biology from the University of the South Pacific and pioneered non-invasive reproductive and stress endocrinology tools for amphibians - the novel development and validation of non-invasive enzyme immunoassays for the evaluation of reproductive hormonal cycle and stress hormone responses to environmental stressors. Dr. Narayan was also a recipient of the Gold Medal Award for undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree from the USP. Dr. Narayan has extensive postdoctoral research fellowship training in institutions spanning 4 countries (New Zealand-Landcare Research), Australia (Griffith University), India (Australian Academy of Science Early Career Fellowship University of Pune), and Canada (Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Saskatchewan). Edward joined Griffith University, Queensland with a successful Vice-Chancellor's postdoctoral fellowship. Edward initiated an innovative long-term research program based on the Conservation Physiology of wildlife. Edward's dynamic career research platform is based on the thematic areas of comparative vertebrate physiology, stress endocrinology, reproductive endocrinology, animal health and welfare, and conservation biology. Edward's research team comprising of supervised Honours, Masters and Ph.D. students (and numerous student volunteers) have made significant new discoveries, including understanding the sub-clinical physiological impacts of the debilitating pathogenic disease (chytridiomycosis) on amphibians; the physiological impacts and fitness consequences of acute and chronic environmental stressors on amphibians. Edward has also developed non-invasive stress hormone monitoring tools for marsupials such as the Koala, Woylie, and the endangered Greater Bilby. Edward has also studied the stress physiology, health, and welfare of Tigers in Australian and Indian Zoos. Edward has supervised over 50 undergraduate special topics, Honours, Masters, and Ph.D. students in Australia and from overseas. Edward has published over 90 peer-reviewed research in collaboration with researchers in Australia such as Murdoch University, Sydney University, University of Melbourne, Macquarie University, Deakin University and Griffith University, and internationally (USA, India, Canada, and New Zealand). Edward also has active on-going research collaborations internationally (e.g. India, Argentina, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pacific Islands, Canada, Brazil, and the USA). Edward's current research program focuses on building resilience in production animals through a combination of physiological, behavioral, and management practice approaches to boost animal health, welfare, and productivity. He leads the Stress Lab and is also an affiliate Senior Research Fellow of the Queensland Alliance of Agriculture and Food Innovation (QAAFI). Edward's research program in livestock strongly connects with livestock farmers groups across regional Australia and currently focuses on Merino sheep reproduction and technology improvements through a research project funded by the Australian Wool Innovation. He is also the recipient of the 2016 Young Rural Innovator Award with funding from Meat and Livestock Australia on stress and shade in spring lamb meat quality. Edward also provides consultation support based on Animal Welfare related work. He currently holds membership in the Endocrine Society of Australia, International Association of Stress Physiologists, Society for Experimental Biology, Australia & New Zealand Society for Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry, and International Society for Wildlife Endocrinology. Previously, Edward has been an academic faculty member at Charles Sturt University (School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences) and Western Sydney University (School of Science). Edward also currently represents the University of Queensland (UQ), as a LINK member for the Universities Federation of Animal Welfare (UFAW). https://www.ufaw.org.uk/university-links-scheme/university-links-scheme Research Pages: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edward_Narayan https://sites.google.com/site/edwardnarayanphysiologylab/ Featured projects Duration Physiological biomarkers to understand the mechanisms driving reptile population dynamics under changing fire regimes Publications Book (1) Book Chapters (9) Journal Articles (92) Conference Papers (16) Preprints (3) Working Papers (6) Research Reports (2) Newspaper Articles (3) Book Narayan, Edward (2014).
