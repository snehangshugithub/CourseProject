Her graduate research focuses on developing computational models for studying the exchange of momentum and scalars over complex surfaces, such as the urban environment. She then worked as a post-doctoral researcher in the Water Center at Columbia University working on numerical simulations of atmospheric turbulence.Research InterestsLi is interested in the fluid dynamics, heat transfer and hydrologic processes in the built environment. She develops and applies numerical models to study how the built environment impacts the land-atmosphere interactions at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Her approach includes both high-performance computing (large-eddy simulations and direct numerical simulations) and field experiment data to develop a physical understanding of the transport of momentum, energy and mass in the built environment. Examples of her current research topics are improving the representations of urban areas in regional weather models and dispersion modeling with improved urban micrometeorological component.Water SystemsEnvironmental Fluid Mechanics and Hydrology Research Group MembersSelected PublicationsLi, Qi, Z-H Wang.2017."Large-eddy simulation of the impact of urban trees on momentum and heat fluxes."
