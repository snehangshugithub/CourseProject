Effects of Thermal Radiation on Solid Propellant Combustion, Summer 1983 Research Statement Professor Brewster conducts fundamental scientific and engineering research in radiation heat transfer, combustion, thermophysical properties of materials, and energetic materials. His laboratory developed the laser-recoil technique for examining dynamic combustion response behavior of solid energetic materials. He and his students developed the theory (sometimes called WSB) of low gas-phase activation energy combustion of energetic solids that resolved and unified steady and unsteady combustion response data of most homogeneous energetic solids. They have also clarified aspects of the more complicated problem of non-premixed combustion of energetic solids. Lately he has worked with students to understand radiative and phase-change heat transfer involving water, including radiation-augmented evaporation and condensation of water and so-called phase-change radiation. Their findings have application to understanding changes associated with global warming and increasing water in Earth's atmosphere. They also address long-standing puzzles in atmospheric science, such as how water droplets can grow in less than an hour from cloud size to sizes where growth by turbulent coalescence can take over (the condensation-coalescence "bottleneck"), the water-vapor radiation continuum problem, and "anomalous" measurements of radiant flux in both cloudy and clear atmospheres.
