Research Areas His primary research project is development of phase-shift nanoemulsions for therapy of solid tumors (kidney, liver, etc). His secondary research project involves delivery of protein therapeutics with an ultrasound-responsive colloid for cardiovascular disorders. Biography Jason Papademetriou completed his B.A. in Physics and M.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular/Cell Biology from Georgetown University. At the university of Maryland College-Park, he worked under the guidance of Dr. Silvia Muro to complete his PhD in Bioengineering which investigated receptor-mediated targeting strategies for nanocarriers using multiple cell surface molecules. He joined the lab for post-doctoral training in November 2013, and is excited at the opportunity to expand his knowledge in many areas (stimuli-responsive colloids, acoustics, image-guided drug delivery, and more).
