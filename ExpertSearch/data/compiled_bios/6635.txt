Seaborg Chair in Physical Chemistry Professor of Chemistry 220 Gilman Hall(510) 643-0841eran.rabani@berkeley.edu Research Group Publications Research Interests Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Prof. Rabani's research involves the development of theoretical and computational tools to investigate fundamental properties of nanostructures. His research covers structural, electronic and optical properties of nanocrystals, doping of nanoparticles, exciton and multiexciton dynamics at the nanoscale, and transport in correlated nano-junctions. Much of this relies on the development of stochastic electronic structure techniques to describe the ground and excited state properties in large-scale nanostructures. In addition, Prof. Rabani has pioneered real-time approaches to nonequilibrium many-body quantum dynamics to describe quantum liquid and glasses and to explore electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in nano-junctions.
