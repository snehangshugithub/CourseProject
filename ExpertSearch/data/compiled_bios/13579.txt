Personal profile Other responsibilitiesDepartmental director of learning and teaching. Research interests Ivan Astin gained a BSc in mathematics at the University of Nottingham, before completing an MSc in statistics and PhD in ionospheric physics at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth.After these, hewas a postdoctoral research associate at NERC's Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere (MST) radar facility, near Aberystwyth.Following that, hewas a research fellow, and later senior research fellow, at the University of Reading's NERCenvironmental systems science centre,where he worked onactive remote sensing of the atmosphere and oceans. Duringthis time he spent a yearas a visiting academicwithin the department of atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.He joined the University of Bath as a lecturer in 2004 and was subsequently promoted to senior lecturer. His research interests lie in the remote sensing of the atmosphere and ionosphere using radio signals. Fingerprint Dive into the research topics where Ivan Astin is active.
