His work has focused on instrumentation and observations of the cosmic microwave background - the relic radiation left over from the big bang - and the evolution of the universe over cosmic time. He is currently actively involved on a number of large cosmological experiments, including the South Pole Telescope (SPT), CMB-S4, and the Terahertz Intensity Mapper (TIM). He regularly observes with major astronomical facilities such as ALMA, Hubble, and soon, JWST. He is the founding director of the Center for AstroPhysical Surveys (CAPS), at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).
