Specifically, we seek to understand mechanisms of neural topographic map formation in the context of the vagus nerve, which is the main route of neuronal communication between the visceral organs and the brain, as well as other axon guidance events. For these studies we use the transparent zebrafish embryo, which is exquisitely accessible both to genetic manipulation and to high-resolution imaging of single neurons, their growing axons, and their activity in vivo For current projects and publications, please visit the Moens Lab Web site: https://research.fredhutch.org/moens/en.html Cecilia Moens is a Member in the Division of Basic Science at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
