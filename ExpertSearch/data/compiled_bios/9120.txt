The overall theme of her past, current and future research projects is building a bridge between real-world applications and the theory of nonlinear mechanics. She is particularly interested in how elastomers and soft biological tissues behave at nano-, micro-, macro- levels; and how this knowledge can be used to advance scientific progress. Professor Sigaeva is actively involved in several biomechanics and biomimetics related projects. One of her main research principles is that theory, simulations, and experiments are complementary, not competitive approaches as such Tais utilizes all three in her research. Finally, she strongly believes in effective multidisciplinary and collaborative practices in order to achieve success in research. Professor Sigaevas specific research interests are: 1. Mechanical testing and constitutive modelling of soft biological tissues, coupling of mechanical testing devices with microscopy to observe deformation of load-bearing fiber components. 2. Quantification of intra- and inter-patient variability in soft biological tissues. 3. Modelling of buckling phenomena in elastomers and soft biological tissues. 4. Universal solution of nonlinear elasticity and their application to biomechanical problems. 5. Tunable behavior of elastomeric structures. Target materials: Healthy and wounded skin, healthy aortas and aneurysms, aortic valves, engineered tissues and elastomeric materials.Research Interestssoft tissuenonlinear elasticitycontinuum mechanicsmechanical testinguniaxial testingbiaxial testingresidual stressdata analysisconstitutive modellingcardiovascular mechanicsfibrous micro-structuremultiphoton microscopyheterogeneityanisotropylayersaneurysmsskinEducation2015, Doctorate, Mechnical Engineering, University of Alberta2011, Specialist (B.Sc. equiv), Mechanics, Southern Federal UniversityCourses*SYDE 182 - Physics 2 (Dynamics)Taught in 2021* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsSigaeva T., Fiori C., Pino Alban M., Beauferris Y., Stagg D., Beddoes R., Di Martino E.S. ``Hands-on, minds-on & science-up'': a concept-based learning laboratory with a taste of research experience for an undergraduate biomedical engineering course.
