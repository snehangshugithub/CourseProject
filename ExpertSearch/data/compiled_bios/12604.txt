During the course of his early employment at the School of Agriculture and Food Sciences (SAFS) in Gatton, he was given the opportunity and responsibility to engage in on-going trans-disciplinary, industry connected and applied research projects in cotton, rubber and oil palm. His primary research interest lies in identifying and developing sustainable agribusiness models in developing countries where activities are largely conducted by small holders with relatively low level of education, small size of planted area, limited capital and often low rate of production. He is particularly interested in how we can integrate the innovation and adoption of technology, financial and risk management techniques and general management practices to achieve improved sustainability and livelihood outcomes. He aims to use his research to positively impact the development of agribusiness in developing countries, such that it enhances the resilience of communities to seasonal variability, unstable fuel prices, rising logistics costs and fluctuating currencies.
