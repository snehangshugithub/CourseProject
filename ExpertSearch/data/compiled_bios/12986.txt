Vision, Todd J. May 20, 2011 Vision, Todd J. Associate Professor tjv@bio.unc.edu 3155 Genome Sciences Building (919) 962-4479 (office) Lab Website The Vision lab studies genome evolution and the architecture of complex traits, with a (non-exclusive) focus on the flowering plants. Among the questions we ask are: What is the genetic basis for ecologically important differences between species, and what evolutionary forces generate that variation? What mutational and evolutionary processes are responsible for the structural rearrangement of chromosomes among taxa? What effect do genome structural changes have on organismal phenotypes? To address these questions, we use the tools of both molecular and computational biology, and are actively involved in the development of new computational methods.
