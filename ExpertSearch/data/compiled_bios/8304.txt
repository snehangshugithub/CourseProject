He served during the Carter Administration as Director of the Conservation and Renewable Energy Policy Office at the Department of Energy, and during the Thompson and Edgar Administrations on many task forces and commissions related to Illinois water and energy policy. He has organized and led statewide citizens groups that, among other things, stopped a reservoir project that would have destroyed Illinois #1 river ecosystem, and established the first National Scenic River in the State. He currently serves on the boards of directors of the National Wildlife Federation and its Illinois affiliate, Prairie Rivers Network.
