Since 1982, research has been directed toward the study of quantum mechanical effects in the transport coefficients of condensed matter systems. Several topics have been investigated including macroscopic quantum tunneling in Josephson junctions, and quantum conductance effects including Aharonov-Bohm oscillations. Since 1991 at UNC, additional research programs in intuitive computer interfaces for microscopies at nanometer-scales, surface manipulation of inorganic and organic samples, carbon nanotube mechanical and electromechanical devices have been established. At the moment the research is aimed at electrical and mechanical properties at the scale of nanometers and at applications of nanometer objects in medicine. Applied Physical Sciences lives in the collaborative space between science and engineering, combining knowledge and discovery with an engineering mindset, team-based science, and entrepreneurship to address real-world problems. The Department of Applied Physical Sciences believes that diversity, equity, and inclusion are crucial to our pursuit of excellence, and is deeply committed to creating a diverse and inclusive community.
