Her research interests mainly revolve around the sustainable management of water resources. Professor Basu is specifically interested in the study of watershed biogeochemistry under climate and land-use change, and observing its linkages with system sustainability and resilience. Other research interests of Professor Basus include understanding fate and transport of nutrients and emerging contaminants in human-dominated landscapes, along with catchment travel-time distributions and their role in predicting water quality across scales. She is also interested in modelling hydrology and water quality in depressional landscapes, and studying the sustainability of water resources. Professor Basus current sources of research funding are from the National Science Foundation, and UW Start-up Funds.Research InterestsNutrient Legacies in Anthropogenic LandscapesWatershed Hydrology and BiogeochemistryFate and Transport of NutrientsEmerging ContaminantsWater QualityModeling Hydrology and Water QualitySustainability of Water Resources in semi-arid regions of the Developing WorldClimate Change and GeosciencesManaging the Risk of Human Activity in Aquatic EcosystemIncreasingly Complex Water ChallengesProtection of Surface and Groundwater ResourcesLegacies of Agriculture PollutantsEducation2006, Doctorate, Environmental Engineering, Purdue University2000, Master of Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology KanpurCourses*CIVE 382 - Hydrol & Open Channel FlowTaught in 2017, 2018, 2019CIVE 497 - Special Topics in Civil EngTaught in 2019, 2020CIVE 770 - Topics in Environmental EngTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsVan Meter, KJ and Basu, NB and Veenstra, JJ and Burras, CL, The nitrogen legacy: emerging evidence of nitrogen accumulation in anthropogenic landscapes, Environmental Research Letters, 11(3), 2016Van Meter, Kimberly J and McLaughlin, Daniel L and Basu, Nandita B, The socioecohydrology of rainwater harvesting in India: understanding water storage and release dynamics across spatial scales, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 20(7), 2016Gall, Heather E and Basu, Nandita B and Mashtare, Michael L and Rao, P Suresh C and Lee, Linda S, Assessing the impacts of anthropogenic and hydro-climatic drivers on estrogen legacies and trajectories, Advances in Water Resources, 87, 2016, 19 - 28Cohen, Matthew J and Creed, Irena F and Alexander, Laurie and Basu, Nandita B and Calhoun, Aram JK and Craft, Christopher and DAmico, Ellen and DeKeyser, Edward and Fowler, Laurie and Golden, Heather E and others, Do geographically isolated wetlands influence landscape functions?, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 113(8), 2016, 1978 - 1986Sloan, Brandon P and Basu, Nandita B and Mantilla, Ricardo, Hydrologic impacts of subsurface drainage at the field scale: Climate, landscape and anthropogenic controls, Agricultural Water Management, 165, 2016, 1 - 10Basu, N.B. and Van Meter, K.J., Changing Waters: Role of Climate-Driven Changes in Discharge Regimes in Increasing Eutrophication Risk in the Great Lakes Basin, 12 , Washington DC.LinkBasu, N.B., Van Meter, K.J., and Van Capellen, P., Beyond the Mass Balance: Modeling Legacy Phosphorus Dynamics in a Great Lakes Watershed, 12 , Washington DC.LinkBasu, N.B., Biogeochemical Hotspots: Role of Small Water Bodies in Watershed Nutrient Processing, 09 , Online.LinkBasu, N.B., Back to the Future: How Past Land Use Impacts current Water Quality, 11 , Columbus, OH, USA.LinkIn the NewsProf selected for sustainability leadership programRestoring wetlands near farms would dramatically reduce water pollutionProf wins international recognition for her water workOutdoor watering restrictions only work in hottest, driest weatherGraduate StudiesCurrently considering applications from graduate students.
