Much of our work uses plant-pollinator interactions as a model system. The Brosi Lab moved to the University of Washington (from Emory University) in September 2020. I was an assistant and then associate professor in the Environmental Sciences Department at Emory University in Atlanta for ten years before moving to the Biology Department at the University of Washington in September 2020. I did my PhD and a post-doc at Stanford in Gretchen Daily's lab. I earned a Master of Environmental Science degree from Yale and worked as a research associate for two years at the New York Botanical Garden before beginning my doctoral work. I grew up in a small town in Kentucky and as an undergraduate was a double major in biology and studio art at Wesleyan.
