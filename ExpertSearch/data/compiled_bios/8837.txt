Abouraddy received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt, in 1994 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Boston University, Boston, MA, in 2003, all in electrical engineering. In 2003 he joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, as a postdoctoral fellow working with Prof. Yoel Fink (Materials Science & Engineering) and Prof. John D. Joannopoulos (Physics), and then became a Research Scientist at the Research Laboratory of Electronics in 2005. At MIT he pursued research on novel multi-material optical fiber structures, photonic bandgap fibers, nanophotonics, fiber-based optoelectronic devices, and mid-infrared nonlinear fiber optics. He has also been engaged in investigating techniques that lead to sub-diffraction-limited resolution in optical microscopy and lithography. He is the coauthor of more than 65 journal publications, 130 conference presentations, and 55 invited talks; he holds seven patents, and has three patents pending. His research also encompasses quantum optics andquantum information processing. He joined CREOL, The College of Optics & Photonics, at the University of Central Florida as an assistant professor in September 2008 where he has since established facilities for fabricating new classes of polymer and soft-glass fibers for applications ranging from mid-infrared optics to solar energy concentration. He also continues to pursue his research testing the foundations of quantum mechanics and implementing optical realizations of quantum computation. He was awarded tenure and promoted to associate professor in August 2014.
