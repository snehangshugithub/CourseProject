His specialty, integer programming, is concerned with mathematical optimization problems where variables can take only integer values and are constrained by linear inequalities. In this context it is natural to study the interaction of point lattices and polyhedra. To solve integer programs and related problems, Dr. Kppe has applied techniques from discrete geometry (Hilbert bases) and algorithmic enumerative combinatorics (rational generating functions).
