Her dissertation research focused on the history and development of tribal libraries in the United States, where she examined the themes of advocacy, leadership, self-determination, cultural knowledge, and government responsibilities to tribes. She has developed advocacy resources for tribal libraries, produced a series of oral histories that document the stories of Arizonas tribal libraries, and oversaw the revision of the 3rd edition of TRAILS, a training manual designed for tribal libraries. As the former Program Manager for the Knowledge River project at the University of Arizona, she recruited and worked to retain students interested in serving Latino and Native American communities. She is a past president of the American Indian Library Association (AILA) and currently serves on several advisory boards for LIS projects in Indigenous communities in the US and Canada. She is an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation, originally from the Four Corners region of New Mexico.
