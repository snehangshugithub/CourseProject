Dr. Lu is leading an I3 (innovative, interdisciplinary, and inclusive) research group to advance the mechanics, materials, electronics, and bio-integration of soft electronics. Representative work of her group includes mechanics of stretchable serpentines, mechanics of micro-bubbles and tents, mechanics of crater-based physically enhanced adhesives, graphene e-tattoos (GETs), cut-solder-paste manufacture of wireless and modular e-tattoos, dual-mode chest e-tattoos for synchronous ECG and SCG etc. She has published more than 100 peer reviewed journal articles so far (with more than 17,000 citations according to Google Scholar), many of which have appeared in high impact journals such as Science, Nature Materials, Nature Nanotechnology, Nature Photonics, Nature Communications, Advance Materials, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS), Physical Review Letters (PRL), Nano Letters, ACS Nano, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, and so on. Her current h-index is 51. She has 2 issued and 5 pending patents. She has presented more than 140 invited talks at major conferences including National Academy of Engineering Frontier of Engineering (NAS FoE) symposium, The Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science of Texas (TAMEST) annual conference, Materials Research Society (MRS) meetings, ASME International Mechanical Engineering Conference & Exposition (IMECE), Society of Engineering Science (SES) technical meetings, IEEE conferences, SPIE conferences, and peer institutes. Her research has been highlighted by news media such as Nature News, Science Online, NSF Science360 News, MIT Technology Review, CNN News, BBC News, NPR, IEEE Spectrum and so on. She has been honored with the NSF CAREER award, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) and Office of Naval Research (ONR) Young Investigator Programs, the MITs Technology Review 35 under 35 (TR 35), the 3M Nontenured Faculty Award, the iCANx/ACS Nano Rising Star lectureship, and the NetExplo Grand Prix. She is a senior member of IEEE. Dr. Lu was also selected as one of the five great innovators on campus by UT Austin Central Communications in 2016 and one of the five world-changing women at UT Austin in 2019. She is enlisted as one of the 2020 Web of Science Highly Cited Researchers.
