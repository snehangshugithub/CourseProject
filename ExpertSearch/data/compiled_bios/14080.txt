He earned his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from RPI in 2011 and 2016, respectively. Dr. Elshafee's primary research interests are centrifuge modeling, soil-structure interaction, soil dynamics, and numerical modelling. The centrifuge experiments, supplemented by high-quality reliable measurements, have been used to develop or calibrate new design or retrofit engineering methods. He is a reviewer for technical journals, including Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Journal, Soils and Foundations Journal, and others. He is currently serving as a faculty senator representing contingent faculty. He served as the course coordinator for Strength of Materials numerous times. Also, he is the RPI Geowall team faculty adviser which recently won the national competition held in Minneapolis (February 2020). He has a strong teaching background he believes that teaching is like tailoring a suit for a customer which is the student. He is currently teaching core classes like Intro to Engineering Analysis, Strength of materials where he served as the course coordinator (2017 Present), and Intro to Engineering Design. Also, he taught in Egypt for 2.5 years where he was responsible for an elective course and mentoring undergrad thesis of geotechnical major students.
