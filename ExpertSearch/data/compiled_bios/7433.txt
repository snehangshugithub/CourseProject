He has taught Mechanical Engineering courses in freshman design, sophomore design, computer aided design, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, senior design, lean manufacturing, and combustion engine systems. He has both a practitioner and research interest in instructional design, active learning strategies, assessment for learning, and faculty development. Early in his career he was active in the Center for Applied Thermodynamic Studies where among other things he worked on equations of state used by the international natural gas industry for pipeline operations and sales. For the last twenty years, he has been an active participant in the National Center for Advanced Transportation Technology (NIATT). He has been involved in multiple generations of student vehicle projects, including an electric racecar the one the Arizona Electrics Competition in 1999, DOE Future Truck, SAE FSAE, SAE FHSAE where UI placed first in international competition in 2013, and the Clean Snowmobile Competition where UI has placed in the top three multiple times over the last fifteen years. Since 2015 Dr. Beyerlein has served as the Mechanical Engineering Department Chair where he has diversified the industrial advisory board, spearheaded major shop/lab infrastructure improvements, connected with many UI alumni through e-communications as well as social events around the northwest, and contributed to program assessment/accreditation efforts at the college as well as institution level.

Kumar Outreach Projects Dr. Beyerlein collaborates with Dr. Shrestha in Biological Engineering in leading the DOE sponsored UI Industrial Assessment Center. This manufacturing assistance unit hires student interns, visits mid-size manufacturing facilities in the northwest, and provides detailed energy audit reports. The DOE program supports energy engineering education as well as outreach to regional industry. UI students in the program have made over $2M/year of energy saving recommendations that have been adopted by clients across Washington, Idaho, and Montana. Dr. Beyerlein is also highly active in the UI interdisciplinary capstone design program recognized by the National Academy of Engineers and he has served on the organizing committee of the Capstone Design Conference since 2010. Dr. Beyerlein is also one of the original developers of the popular Mindworks website which is a portal for just-in-time design and manufacturing learning that supports numerous curriculum classes.
