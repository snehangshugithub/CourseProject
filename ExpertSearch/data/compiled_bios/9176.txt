She holds a PhD in Materials Science and Computational Mechanics from Mines ParisTech (2016), a Master of Science in Energy, Materials and Processing (2013) as well as a Master of Engineering in Materials and Mechanics (2013) from Mines Saint Etienne. Supported by a fellowship by the French Agency for Research and Technology for her graduate studies , she investigated microstructure evolution mechanisms during high temperature forming in new generation polycrystalline nickel base superalloys. Her work was awarded the Prize for the best PhD thesis by the French Society for Materials and Metals (2017) and she was named a Rising Talent of the Womens Forum for the Economy and Society (2017). The same year, she moved to the United States to work with Professor Tresa Pollock at the University of California in Santa Barbara. During 4.5 years spent there, she developped numerical tools to analyze plasticity and strain localization processes statistically and automatically, in a variety of structural materials under mechanical loading (superalloys, titanium alloys, refractory metals, high entropy alloys). This rich experience gives her unique insights on pathways to optimize materials microstructures -hence forming processes- for improved mechanical properties and durability.Committed to gender equality, she has participated to several conferences dedicated to Women in STEM where she was an invited speaker, including the DEAN's Forum in Paris (2017), Women's Forum in Mexico city (2017) and W.IN Forum in New York (2018).Aside from science, Marie is an active classical concert pianist and has given over 50 recitals across Europe and the USA. She graduated from the Conservatory of music with the highest honors in 2013 and is a winner of several international piano competitions.
