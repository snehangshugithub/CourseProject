The research uses liquid xenon detectors to probe rare physics properties in an attempt to identify the content and properties of the fundamental constituents of matter. As a member of the XENON1T and XENONnT dark matter experiments, and the nEXO neutrinoless double beta decay experiment, this research probes theories beyond the standard model of particle physics, and attempts to detect and characterize dark matter and the nature of the neutrino.
