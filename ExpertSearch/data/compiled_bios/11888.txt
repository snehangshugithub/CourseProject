Dalian University of Technology, 2010B.S. Dalian University of Technology, 2007 Research Interests: Solid MechanicsMechanics and multi-physics of soft materialsNano-mechanicsBio-inspired design Current Research: Zhang groups current research goal is to explore the fundamental mechanism of the extraordinary mechanical performances (i.e., high toughness, great fatigue resistance, and strong adhesion) of biomaterials, such as cartilage, heart valves, bones, and mussel plague and to propose the novel design principle of the bio-inspired smart materials. To achieve this goal, we employ multiscale and multiphysics modeling and simulations to understand the mechanics of the key components of biomaterials: hard materials for stiffness, soft materials for stretchability and tough interface for robustness. The current research focuses on: (1) Hard materials: mechanics of graphene and the general two-dimensional materials.(2) Soft materials: fracture and excessive deformation of soft materials, including hydrogels, elastomers, and cells.(3) Interface: strong under-water adhesion and the effect of cavitation and materials failure on the interfacial toughness.
