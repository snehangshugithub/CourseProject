We use tools from molecular, quantitative, and population genetics to identify the physiological basis of plant response to environmental cues, and ask how these mechanisms constrain or facilitate plant breeding and evolutionary change.Awards and HonorsWalter Fitch Prize, Society for Molecular Biology and EvolutionSelected PublicationsDes Marais, D.
