Current research activities pertain to travel behavior analyses, urban travel forecasting methods, emissions modeling, and the properties of solutions to the traffic assignment problem with fixed and variable demand. Translab has three transportation faculty. Faculty with expertise in activity-based modeling, travel behavior, air quality modeling, traditional transportation planning and transportation economics work with undergraduate, masters and doctoral students interested in transportation. Research is built around transportation planning and operationsis and is oriented towards methods for the planning, design, and operation of surface transportation systems. Solutions to problems in surface transportation facilities (infrastructure) are sought through the application of optimization and simulation methods. Our well established program has strong faculty support and well-developed interactions with the Urban Transportation Center (UTC). The Urban Transportation Center (UTC) is an interdisciplinary research unit at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). The center focuses on transportation research, education and outreach. The center has working relationships with local, regional, statewide and national agencies such as the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP), Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT), Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), US DOT and the National Science Foundation (NSF).
