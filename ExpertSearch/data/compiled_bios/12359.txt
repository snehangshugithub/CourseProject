Hemann uses mouse models to combat cancers resistant to chemotherapy. 617-324-1964 Phone 76-361 Office hemann@mit.edu Email Lab Website Ryan Hayman Assistant 617-253-0796 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 2001, Johns Hopkins University BS, 1993, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Wesleyan University Research Summary Many human cancers do not respond to chemotherapy, and often times those that initially respond eventually acquire drug resistance. Our lab uses high-throughput screening technology combined with murine stem reconstitution and tumor transplantation systems to investigate the genetic basis for this resistance. Our goal is to identify novel cancer drug targets, as well as strategies for tailoring existing cancer therapies to target the vulnerabilities associated with specific malignancies.
