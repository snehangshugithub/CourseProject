He received his S.B. degree in physics from MIT. He did his PhD research in Experimental Nuclear Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His PhD thesis focused on experiments which used real Compton scattering on the proton at 2-6 GeV, allowing to probe the proton's internal structure and how it couples to external excitations. After his PhD Areg worked at Los Alamos as a postdoctoral researcher, and then as a senior scientist at Passport Systems, Inc (PSI). At PSI Areg focused on the development of Prompt Neutron from Photofission (PNPF) technique, which allows to rapidly detect shielded fissionable materials in the commercial cargo traffic. Aregs research focuses on leveraging nuclear physics to mitigate the dangers of nuclear materials and weapons. He is currently working on new,monochromatic methodologies for cargo screeningas well as technologies fortreaty verification via resonant phenomena and physical cryptography. download CV Awards Arms Control Persons of the Year, ACA, 2019 Radiation Science and Technology Award, ANS, 2019 Teaching with Digital Technology Award Nomination, MIT, 2016 IEEE/NPSS Radiation Instrumentation Early Career Award, 2015 Award for Superior Performance in Support of the DNDO Mission (issued to the SNAR team, PSI), 2012 Research Verification of nuclear disarmament treaties via resonant phenomena and physical cryptography.
