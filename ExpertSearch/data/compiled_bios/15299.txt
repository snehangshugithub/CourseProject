My research interests include computer architecture and microarchitecture, hardware-software co-designs, accelerators, and emerging application domains especially those in big data analytics such as genomics, graphs, and databases. One of my research goalsis to greatly simplify thedesign, deployment, and usageof custom hardware and to leverage thisresearch in hardware acceleration to advance state-of-the-art research in the healthcare domain as well asother natural sciences.
