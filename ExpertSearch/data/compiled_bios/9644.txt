He received a Ph.D. in applied physics from Cornell University, where he worked on nonlinear optical microscopy in the laboratory of Watt Webb. For postdoctoral studies, he was a Croucher Fellow studying cortical microcircuits with Yang Dan at the University of California, Berkeley. Since 2013, he has been a faculty member in the Department of Psychiatry at Yale University.The Kwan lab applies systems neuroscience and neuroengineering approaches to the study of mental health. We develop optical imaging techniques to visualize neural dynamics in awake mice. We design quantitative decision-making paradigms to characterize behavior. We often complement the imaging and behavioral experiments with other molecular, electrophysiological, optogenetic, and computational methods.Current effort in the lab is directed towards two topics: (1) Drug action in the brain: Psychiatric drugs exert powerful effects in humans characterized by altered perception, cognition, and mood. The lab studies the action of psychoactive drugs, including ketamine and serotonergic psychedelics such as psilocybin, on the function and connectivity of neurons in the frontal cortex. (2) Decision-making: Animals use past choice and reward history to guide their current decisions. We are interested in how neural circuits may implement reinforcement learning, and whether reward learning dysfunctions may be a useful metric to quantify neuropsychiatric conditions.To learn more about the lab, please visit the Kwan Lab website.Research InterestsDrug Delivery and NanomedicineBiomedical Imaging and InstrumentationBioengineeringBiomedical EngineeringNeuroscienceBiophysicsSelected PublicationsShao LX, Liao C, Gregg I, Davoudian PA, Savalia NK, Delagarza K, and Kwan AC.
