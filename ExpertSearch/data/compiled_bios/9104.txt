In his Ph.D., he investigated the consequences of the loss of temporal synchrony on speech intelligibility in noise. The loss of synchrony in the auditory system reduces temporal information that is available to a listener's brain and can occur as a result of aging and/or synaptopathy (often referred to as "hidden" hearing loss). After graduating from the University of Toronto, he moved to Queen's University and investigated the role of auditory feedback on control of speech production. This work examined how talkers changed their speech when the acoustic feedback they received was altered in real-time. In 2011, Ewen moved to Copenhagen to take a faculty position at the Technical University of Denmark. There he continued his research into the perceptual consequences of hearing loss and how they can be addressed by hearing assistive devices. A recent focus of his research has been on the timing of turn taking in interactive conversation and how this can be used to evaluate hearing-aid signal processing.Research InterestsSpeech PerceptionSpeech ProductionSpeech CommunicationPerceptual Consequences of Hearing loss and AgingHearing Aid ProcessingAuditory PerceptionAcousticsEducation2007, Doctorate, Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto2002, Master of Applied Science, Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto1999, Bachelor of Applied Science, Engineering Science, University of TorontoCourses*BME 284 - Physiological & Biological SysTaught in 2021* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsSrensen AJM, Fereczkowski M, MacDonald EN, The effects of noise and second language on conversational dynamics in task dialogue, Trends in Hearing, 25, 2021Kowalewski B, Fereczkowski M, Strelcyk O, MacDonald E, Dau T, Assessing the effects of hearing-aid compression on auditory spectral and temporal resolution using an auditory modeling framework, Acoustical Science and Technology, 41(1), 2020, 214 - 222Kowalewski B, Zaar J, Fereczkowski M, MacDonald EN, Strelcyk O, May T, Dau T, Effects of Slow-and Fast-Acting Compression on Hearing-Impaired Listeners Consonant--Vowel Identification in Interrupted Noise, Trends in hearing, 22, 2018Fereczkowski M, Jepsen ML, Dau T, MacDonald EN, Investigating time-efficiency of forward masking paradigms for estimating basilar membrane input-output characteristics, PloS one, 12(3), 2017Ohlenforst B, Souza PE, MacDonald EN, Exploring the Relationship Between Working Memory, Compressor Speed, and Background Noise Characteristics., Ear and hearing, 37(2), 2016, 137 - 143Chabot-Leclerc A, MacDonald EN, Dau T, Predicting binaural speech intelligibility using the signal-to-noise ratio in the envelope power spectrum domain, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 140(1), 2016, 192 - 205Lcsei G, Pedersen JH, Laugesen S, Santurette S, Dau T, MacDonald EN, Temporal fine-structure coding and lateralized speech perception in normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners, Trends in Hearing, 20, 2016MacDonald EN, Johnson EK, Forsythe J, Plante P, Munhall KG, Children's development of self-regulation in speech production, Current Biology, 22(2), 2012, 113 - 117MacDonald EN, Purcell DW, Munhall KG, Probing the independence of formant control using altered auditory feedback, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 129(2), 2011, 955 - 965MacDonald EN, Goldberg R, Munhall KG, Compensations in response to real-time formant perturbations of different magnitudes, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 127(2), 2010, 1059 - 1068Munhall KG, MacDonald EN, Byrne SK, Johnsrude I, Talkers alter vowel production in response to real-time formant perturbation even when instructed not to compensate, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 125(1), 2009, 384 - 390Pichora-Fuller MK, Schneider BA, MacDonald E, Pass HE, Brown S, Temporal jitter disrupts speech intelligibility: A simulation of auditory aging, Hearing research, 223(1-2), 2007, 114 - 121Graduate StudiesCurrently considering applications from graduate students.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
