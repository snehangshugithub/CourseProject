University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Areas of Expertise Real-Time Systems Synchronization Background My research is in the area of real-time systems. These systems have timing constraints that we must guarantee will always be met. Such systems are often cyber-physical systems, which have components that interact with the physical world. These interactions highlight the need for system certification. The processes within a system often require access to shared software or hardware components, called resources. Synchronization protocols coordinate resource access among processes in the system. In a real-time system, we must bound the delay caused by these protocols and account for this delay when checking whether timing constraints will be met. My focus is on developing and analyzing synchronization protocols for real-time systems. I also consider the impact of scheduler decisions on these protocols. Systems that require reader/writer or multi-resource access are especially interesting, as they present additional challenges in supporting the required resource-sharing paradigms and producing tight analyses on worst-case delays. In my spare time, I enjoy gardening and spending time outdoors.
