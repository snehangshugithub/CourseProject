She received her PhD in machine learning from Carnegie Mellon University in 2010. Her research focuses on heterogeneous machine learning, rare category analysis, active learning and semi-supervised learning, with applications in social network analysis, healthcare, and manufacturing processes. She is the recipient of the 2016 NSF CAREER Award and a three-time recipient of the IBM Faculty Award, in 2018, 2015 and 2014 respectively, and was selected for an IJCAI 2017 Early Career Spotlight. He has published more than 90 refereed articles, and is the author of the book, Analysis of Rare Categories (Springer-Verlag, 2011). Her papers have been selected as "Bestof the Conference" by ICDM 2016, ICDM 2010, and SDM 2010. She has served on the senior program committee/program committee for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM), and International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).
