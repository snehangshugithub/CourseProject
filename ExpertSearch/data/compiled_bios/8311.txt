She investigates materials theoretically and experimentally and designs new advanced materials based on bioinspiration for various medical and technological applications. The engineering materials of interest include composites and nanocomposites, polymers, and alloys for aerospace, automotive, and energy applications. The biological materials studies address the mechanics of bone and hoof. She is also designing new bioinspired materials and 3D printing them using various additive manufacturing techniques. One ongoing project on bone aims to explain the mechanics of bone at different structural scales to obtain predictive tools for healthy and diseased bone. She is also exploring computational and non-invasive experimental tools for use in clinical settings to diagnose bone health. The project on natural materials investigates a hoof wall and hoof-inspired materials. Professor Jasiuk is studying, jointly with Professor Marc Meyers from the University of California at San Diego, the structure, composition, and mechanical properties of the hoof wall at different structural levels. They are also designing hoof-inspired impact-resistant materials for various engineering applications. She also designs, manufactures, characterizes, and models novel architectured cellular bioinspired multifunctional materials. She employs different additive manufacturing techniques to create models for testing and investigates their mechanical, electrical, thermal, acoustic, and electromagnetic properties. Finally, Professor Jasiuk is a site director of the NSF I/UCRC Center on Novel High Voltage/Temperature Materials and Structures. She designs and explores novel high-temperature composite and nanocomposite materials for aerospace applications and high-conductivity alloys for power transmission. Undergraduate Research Opportunities Several projects are available on the characterization and modeling of materials.
