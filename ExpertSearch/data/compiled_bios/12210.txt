She published the monograph, Documenting Aftermath: Information Infrastructures in the Wake of Disasters, about postearthquake communication practices. Her newer projects examine ethical research practices in the field of computer security, and investigate the implications of novel information policies on a transnational scale. She brings together perspectives and approaches from information studies, science and technology studies, and the history of media, information, and communication. In addition to her research and teaching, she is an advisor for the Science, Technology, & Society Studies (STSS) Graduate Certificate program, a member of the iSchool's DataLab, and starting in 2019, a core faculty in Data Science Studies at the eScience Institute.
