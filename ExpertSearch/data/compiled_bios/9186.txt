She obtained her PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from UIUC with Prof. Steve Granick (2012) and did her postdoc with Prof. Paul Alivisatos at UC Berkeley under the prestigious Miller Fellowship. She joined the faculty of UIUC in 2015 and since then has received awards for the research in her group such as the Victor LaMer award in ACS (2015), Forbes 30 under 30 Science List (2016), AFOSR YIP award (2017), NSF CAREER award (2018) and Sloan Research Fellow in Chemistry (2018). The research in her group focuses on the broad scheme of imaging, understanding and engineering active soft matter, including systems such as nanoparticle and colloidal self-assembly, protein aggregation, advanced battery devices, and energy-efficient water filtration.
