Emelko is a Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Canada Research Chair in Water Science, Technology & Policy. She is also the Director of the Water Science, Technology & Policy Group. She is also cross-appointed in Biology, Geography & Environmental Management, Systems Design Engineering, and the School of Planning. Professor Emelko's research interests focus on drinking water supply and treatment, source water protection, microbial risk assessment, public health policy, and stormwater and advanced wastewater treatment. She focuses on sustainable technology development and deployment, integrated resource management, climate change adaptation, and the protection of public health. Professor Emelkos research is currently funded by many organizations including the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), the Water Research Foundation, and Alberta Innovates as well as several industry and government partners. She co-leads the Southern Rockies Watershed Project team, which evaluates the initial effects of natural disturbance by wildfire on hydrology, water quality, and aquatic ecology; and monitors the recovery of these values in front range headwater streams of the high water yielding eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains. Professor Emelko's team was among the first cited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for identifying climate change-associated threats from wildfire to drinking water security through water quality and treatability. Her ongoing work involves active participation from over 3 dozen utilities and conservation authorities across Canada and the United States. Professor Emelko has served as a technical advisor to the U.S. National Academies of Engineering, Science, and Medicine as well as several federal and provincial/state agencies in Canada, the United States, and Australia regarding regulatory development related to drinking water treatment, source water protection, public health policy, and integrated resource management.Research InterestsWater treatmentWildfireWater qualityPathogensClimate changeFiltrationLand disturbanceEnvironmental & Water ResourcesWater and Land ManagementNanoparticle Removal during Drinking Water and Wastewater TreatmentQuanititative Microbial Risk AssessmentWater ProtectionSmart InfrastructureEducation2001, Doctorate, Civil Engineering, University of Waterloo1995, Master's, Civil Engineering, UCLA1994, Bachelor's, Environmental Engineering Science, MIT1993, Bachelor's, Chemical Engineering, MITCourses*CIVE 670 - Phys-Chem Treatment ProcessesTaught in 2016, 2017, 2021CIVE 770 - Topics in Environmental EngTaught in 2016ENVE 224 - Probability & StatisticsTaught in 2019, 2020GEOE 224 - Probability & StatisticsTaught in 2020* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsEmmerton CA, Cooke CA, Hustins S, Silins U, Emelko MB, Lewis T, Kruk MK, Taube N, Zhu D, Jackson B, Stone M, Kerr JG, Orwin JF, Severe western Canadian wildfire affects water quality even at large basin scales, Water Research, 183(116071), 2020LinkChik AHS, Emelko MB, Blaschke AP, Schijven JF, Illuminating Subsurface Microbial Water Quality Patterns Using Adenosine Triphosphate and Dynamic Time Warping Approaches, Groundwater Monitoring & Remediation, 40(3), 2020, 55 - 66LinkAdrian L.
