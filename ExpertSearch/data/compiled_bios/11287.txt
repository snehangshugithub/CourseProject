His major duties are to develop and conduct research and extension programs in animal genomics and related subject areas that ultimately benefit dairy and livestock industries.. Programs Research Research Summary Dr. Peagaricano is broadly interested in statistical and quantitative genetics and genomics. His research program focuses on the development and application of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of phenotypic and molecular data in livestock species. Current research topics include (1) genetic and genomic analysis of production, reproduction, and health traits in dairy cattle, (2) evaluation of the effects of maternal nutrition during pregnancy on the epigenome and transcriptome of the offspring, and (3) inference of causal gene-phenotype networks in multivariate genetic systems combining structural equation models and molecular information. Extension Extension: Area of Speciality; Dairy Breeding and Genomics The extension program focuses on educating dairy and livestock producers and allied industries about practical and economically important aspects of genetic and genomic evaluation and selection, including the transfer of new research findings.
