Program in Interdisciplinary Biological SciencesDownload CVEducationPhD, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA MEng, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA BS, Bogazici University, Istanbul, TurkeyResearch InterestsMy research expertise is on computational materials science and mechanics, emphasizing two areas: (1) nanostructured polymeric materials and (2) biomolecular and bioinspired materials. My career goal is to establish theory and simulation-driven approaches to understanding the physics of soft materials at multiple-length scales, typically utilizing molecular dynamics and theoretical approaches. I envision that creating faster and more accurate computational methods, and also learning from biological design principles, will accelerate the design of new materials for structural use, separations, and broader applications relevant to energy, environment, and infrastructure. Designing biomolecular and polymeric materials by theory-driven approaches remains at its infancy because of the dynamic nature of these systems at the nanoscale, and because of the intricacy of the nanoscale interfaces in these systems.Significant RecognitionASME Sia Nemat-Nasser Early Career Award (2019)ASCE Huber Research Prize (2019)JMBBM Early Career Researcher Award (2018)Society of Engineering Science Young Investigator Award (2018)NAE US Frontiers of Engineering Symposium Participant (2017)Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) (2017)Fellow, American Physical Society (Division of Polymer Physics) (2016)Office of Naval Research Director of Research Early Career Award (ONR) (2016)Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award (ONR YIP) (2015)SEARLE Fellow for Teaching Excellence (2014)ASME Applied Mechanics Division Haythornthwaite RIG Award (2012)Materials Research Society Graduate Student Award (2009)MIT Philip Loew Memorial Award (2008) MIT Emerson Music Scholarship (2007-2009) MIT Presidential Graduate Fellowship (2006)Significant Professional ServiceAssociate Editor for npj Computational MaterialsMember of the editorial board for BioNanoScience, Scientific Reports and ACS Biomaterials Science and EngineeringSelected PublicationsDansuk, Kerim C.; Keten, Sinan, A Simple Mechanical Model for Synthetic Catch Bonds, Matter 1(4):911-925.Hansoge, Nitin K.; Keten, Sinan, Effect of Polymer Chemistry on Chain Conformations in Hairy Nanoparticle Assemblies, ACS Macro Letters 8(10):1209-1215.Dunbar, Martha; DeBenedictis, Elizabeth; Keten, Sinan, Dimerization energetics of curli fiber subunits CsgA and CsgB, npj Computational Materials 5(1).Wang, Ao; Keten, Sinan, Adhesive behavior and detachment mechanisms of bacterial amyloid nanofibers, npj Computational Materials 5(1).Li, Tianjiao; Meng, Zhaoxu; Keten, Sinan, Interfacial mechanics and viscoelastic properties of patchy graphene oxide reinforced nanocomposites, Carbon 158:303-313.Qin, Xin; Marchi, Benjamin C.; Meng, Zhaoxu; Keten, Sinan, Impact resistance of nanocellulose films with bioinspired Bouligand microstructures, Nanoscale Advances 1(4):1351-1361.Darnall, Shawn M.; Li, Changyi; Dunbar, Martha; Alsina, Marco; Keten, Sinan; Helms, Brett A.; Xu, Ting, Organic Nanotube with Subnanometer, pH-Responsive Lumen, Journal of the American Chemical Society 141(28):10953-10957.Zhang, Yao; Debenedictis, Elizabeth P.; Keten, Sinan, Cohesive and adhesive properties of crosslinked semiflexible biopolymer networks, Soft Matter 15(18):3807-3816.Xia, Wenjie; Hansoge, Nitin K.; Xu, Wen Sheng; Phelan, Frederick R.; Keten, Sinan; Douglas, Jack F., Energy renormalization for coarse-graining polymers having different segmental structures, Science Advances 5(4).Natarajan, Bharath; Krishnamurthy, Ajay; Qin, Xin; Emiroglu, Caglar D.; Forster, Amanda; Foster, E.
