(Bob) McCann has been creating, directing and teaching Leadership and Management Communication courses across virtually all of UCLA Andersons MBA degree programs since coming to UCLA in 2010. He also teaches courses that include: Entrepreneurship; Global Leadership; Persuasion & Leadership; Leading & Doing Business in Thailand; and Doing Business in Southeast Asia in Andersons EMBA, FEMBA and full-time MBA programs. Dr. McCann holds his primary faculty appointment at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, and a secondary appointment at the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science. Concurrently he is deeply engaged in many of UCLA Andersons executive education programs and annually teaches undergraduate classes in communication, global leadership and entrepreneurship at the University of Hong Kong. He is also the Faculty Director and/or Learning Director for multiple programs at UCLA Anderson Executive Education, including Andersons PGPX and PGP Pro programs in India and the USA, the Executive Program in Advanced Leadership and Management, and the Geffen School of Medicine Executive Leadership Program. Head of an active consulting business, McCann specializes in the training of executives and professionals in persuasion, leadership, workplace diversity and all aspects of the strategic use of communication in business settings. Some of the companies for which he has provided service include: Jet Propulsion Laboratories, Fox Entertainment Group, Marriott International, Johnson & Johnson Health Care, MTR (Hong Kong), CUHK (Hong Kong), UCLA Hospital, College Board, Pfizer, Novartis, Nestl and Schering-Plough. McCanns research interests, which include workplace ageism, leadership, intergroup communication, cross-cultural communication and age diversity, can be traced back to his father, who at age 94 continues to put in 40-hour weeks as an executive in the printing industry. My father is not alone, McCann says. Either by choice or necessity, older individuals around the world are working well into their so-called retirement years in numbers greater than ever before. And they are thriving. My dad and other such workers are the inspiration for my research on older workers. The research McCann conducts is relevant to pressing societal issues and has strong practical implications. Some of his recent work on the communicative dimensions of age biases was recently utilized in a U.S. Supreme Court amicus brief on age discrimination. He has also served as principal investigator on UCLAs multiyear Center for International Business and Education Research (CIBER) grant. McCann's work has been published in several major refereed communication journals and has won numerous research awards. For more than a decade, he has served on the executive editorial board of the Journal of Asian Pacific Communication. His latest book, titled Ageism at Work: The Role of Communication in a Changing Workplace, is available in Spanish, Catalan and English. A frequent media consultant in the areas of management communication, leadership, workplace ageism and age diversified workplaces, McCann has appeared on National Public Radioand in Bloomberg BusinessWeek, US News and World Report, Chicago Tribune, The New York Times, GQ, Esquire, The Atlanta Journal Constitution, The Capital Timesand International Herald Tribune. McCann lived in Asia for nearly 20 years, most of which were spent in Thailand, where he worked both in academia (at the Sasin Graduate Institute of Business Administration of Chulalongkorn University) and in the private sector, where he helped spearhead Diageo's relationship marketing efforts in Asia for the Johnnie Walker line of products. He also worked in international banking in Karachi, Pakistan, and London, England. At present McCann holds the chair of the UCLA Thailand Executive Committee and serves on the faculty advisory committee of UCLA's Center for Southeast Asian Studies. He is the former associate dean for global initiatives at UCLA Anderson. McCann has received several teaching awards and dean's commendations around the globe, including the prestigious "Golden Apple" Teaching Award.
