We study a wide range of materials with very different properties, which include semiconductors, superconductors and magnets etc. We stack them together to form heteostructures, and make electronics and opto-mechanical devices based on this material platform. To explore new phenomena, we also develop new measurement and imaging techniques suitable for specific problems on hand. Our ultimate goal is to push the limit on what can be seen and done in this two-dimensional world.Courses TaughtPHYS 4443 - Intermediate Quantum MechanicsSelected PublicationsValley magnetoelectricity in single-layer MoS2.
