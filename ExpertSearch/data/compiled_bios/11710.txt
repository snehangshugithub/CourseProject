Bourne Founding Dean, School of Data ScienceProfessor, Biomedical Engineering Home Find Faculty Philip E. Bourne Bio Ph.D. The Flinders University of South Australia, 1979 "Leading initiatives to encourage and facilitate the use of big data in large-scale research across the scientific and technological disciplines." Philip E. Bourne, Dean of the School of Data Science Philip E. Bourne leads a range of initiatives to encourage and facilitate the use of big data in large-scale research across the scientific and technological disciplines, with special emphasis on structural bioinformatics and systems pharmacology. He is the Founding Dean of the School of Data Science and Professor of Biomedical Engineering. From 2014-2017, Phil was the Associate Director for Data Science at the National Institutes of Health. In this role he led the Big Data to Knowledge Program, coordinating access to and analyzing biomedical research from across the globe and making it available to scientists and researchers. While there, he was also responsible for governance and strategic planning activities for data and knowledge management, and established multiple trainings in data science. He has done exceptional work to make biomedical research accessible, as well as to advance the field of data science. Prior to his time at the NIH, Phil spent 20 years on the faculty at the University of California-San Diego, eventually becoming Associate Vice Chancellor of Innovation and Industrial Alliances. He is a highly respected and oft-cited scholar who brings a wealth of experience to UVA.
