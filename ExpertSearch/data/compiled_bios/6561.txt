He is an Associate Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and a member of the Optical Society of America and Society of Automotive Engineers. He is a 2009 recipient of a National Science Foundation CAREER award to study turbulence-chemistry interactions. Teaching Experience Mas teaching experience lies in the general areas of thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, laser sensing, combustion, engineering mathematics, and related laboratory courses. Research Interests Research focuses on the study of propulsion systems, with a special strength in the development and application of advanced optical diagnostics. Specific research directions include the study of fundamental turbulence-chemistry interactions, aerospace propulsion devices, internal combustion engines, fuel spray physics and chemistry, and nano-scale energetic materials. Dr. Mas expertise in laser diagnostics brings a unique capability to the department and the Commonwealth Center for Aerospace Propulsion Systems. His expertise is expected to provide test data for the validation of combustion models, a critical aspect in the development of modern propulsion systems. Such validated models are solely needed to reduce the cost and accelerate the development cycle of new propulsion systems.
