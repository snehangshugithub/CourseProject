This is a phenomenonthat I have come to refer to asexperience-taking. My cross-disciplinary work (utilizing approaches from social psychology, communication, and media studies) has uncovered several key antecedents of experience-taking (such as the level of psychological distance between individuals and characters) and revealed the impact of experience-taking on real-life behaviors (such as volunteering and voting). My work has alsoshown how deep connections with characters in fictional worlds can be an effective means of increasing empathy and reducing prejudice.In collaboration with my colleagues at Dartmouth College's Tiltfactor Lab,I am also deeply involved in thedevelopmentand research of games for social impact. This work has guided the formulationof a model of "embedded design": strategies ofinterweaving or obscuring the persuasive content or intentions of a game to increase its impact without sacrificing player immersion or enjoyment. Ongoing work is testing the application of these strategies to games aiming to reduce social biases, model effective bystander intervention techniques, and encourage pro-environmental habits and behaviors.
