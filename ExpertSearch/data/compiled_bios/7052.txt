My current research is focused on exploring how cell cycle progression influences transcription and cell determination. I use Drosophila and marine invertebrate embryos in my studies. Victoria Foe received her Ph.D. in 1975 from the University of Texas at Austin where she worked with Hugh Forrest on the induction of transcriptional activity during embryogenesis. She followed this with postdoctoral studies in the laboratories of Charles Laird at the University of Washington--studying the functional organization of chromatin, and Bruce Alberts at the University of California in San Francisco--studying the interplay between the cell cycle and morphogenesis. In 1991 she joined the University of Washington Zoology Department. She is a Research Professor in the Department of Biology and was a founding member of the Center for Cell Dynamics at Friday Harbor Laboratories. Her honors include a Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship from the American Cancer Society, a Guggenheim Fellowship and a MacArthur Fellowship.
