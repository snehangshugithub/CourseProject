Read More Professor Li's Team Creates Bio-Inspired Composite Stronger Than Aluminum Professor Li's Team Creates Bio-Inspired Composite Stronger Than Aluminum Instead of seeking a way to avoid damaging the included graphene we have instead put forward a smart manufacturing method that takes advantage of the reaction between graphene oxide and Al. We were able to effectively reduce graphene oxide into defective graphene and Al2O3, with the Al2O3 acting... Read More Inspired By The World, Chris Li Turns Nature Into Nanotechnology Inspired By The World, Chris Li Turns Nature Into Nanotechnology The key to Xiaodong (Chris) Lis success is his ability to see opportunity in the ordinary. Take, for example, the common cotton T-shirt. Where others might see a ubiquitous item of apparel, Li recently appointed Rolls-Royce Commonwealth Professor at the University of VirginiasSchool of Engineering and Applied Science sees a platform for innovation.
