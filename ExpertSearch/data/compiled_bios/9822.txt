Most of my work so far has been in permutation enumeration and its connections to symmetric function theory and combinatorial Hopf algebras. In other words, I study counting problems involving permutations and develop general frameworks for studying these kinds of problems, often drawing upon the rich interplay between combinatorics and abstract algebra. Working with students is my greatest joy at Davidson. My style of teaching empowers students to become active participants in their own learning, and as an educator, I aim to instill self-confidence in my students, to foster a sense of belonging in my classroom, and to cultivate an appreciation for the beauty and power of mathematical abstraction. I supervise undergraduate research projects in combinatorics and I look forward to introducing future students to the excitement of mathematical discovery.
