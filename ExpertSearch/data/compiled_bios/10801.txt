T. L. StClair, NASA Langley Research Center Research Synopsis My group focuses on the design and synthesis of high molecular weight all-aromatic polymers, low molar mass liquid crystals and the conjunction of these two topics in order to engineer new classes of high-performance polymers. For example, we design liquid crystal network polymers, aramids, epoxies, polyimides, and polyaryletherketones that can be used to prepare high-strength fibers, films and (non)continuous fiber reinforced (nano)composites. However, the need for new lightweight materials with the ability to perform both structural and functional tasks is increasing rapidly. This is certainly true for demanding aerospace applications but also for areas related to energy generation, energy storage, water purification and gas separation. In order to meet this need we are designing new high-performance polymer chemistries: Poly(azomethine)s can be used as structural films but at the same time these conjugated polymers can function as the active component in organic photovoltaic and electrochromic devices Poly(etherimide)s (PEIs) can be modified with 0-D, 1-D and 2-D carbon nano structures, which makes them useful for thermoelectric and sensing/actuating applications Non-linear PEIs are structural membranes that have the ability to separate small molecules, for example CO2 from methane, at very high pressures Sulfonated liquid crystal polymers are currently evaluated for water desalination and as proton exchange membranes for fuel-cell applications Liquid crystal block copolymers have been designed with the ability to function as single component high temperature shape-memory structures Our polymer analytical lab is equipped with TA Instruments thermal analysis equipment (TGA5500, DSC2500, ARES-G2 and a RSA-G2), Wyatt Technologies light scattering equipment (Dawn Heleos II) and a Shimadzu Scientific InstrumentsGPC (Prominence) TA Instruments Wyatt Technologies Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Applied Physical Sciences lives in the collaborative space between science and engineering, combining knowledge and discovery with an engineering mindset, team-based science, and entrepreneurship to address real-world problems. The Department of Applied Physical Sciences believes that diversity, equity, and inclusion are crucial to our pursuit of excellence, and is deeply committed to creating a diverse and inclusive community.
