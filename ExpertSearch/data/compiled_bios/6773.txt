Quantum-engineered devices are now at the cusp of achieving rudimentary but real quantum power. However, these quantum technologies must be networked or connected to sensors to achieve useful gain in real applications. The primary goals of our research to i) develop systems that transfer quantum information across long distances, connecting disparate devices over vast ranges of energy; ii) understand the fundamental limits of information transfer in real networks, and iii) develop networked and quantum-enhanced sensors in a deployable setting.
