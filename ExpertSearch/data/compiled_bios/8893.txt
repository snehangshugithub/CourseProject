Honors and Awards IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics, Best Paper Selection (Natural Language Processing) for the paper titled "Bio-SCoRes: A Smorgasbord Architecture for Coreference Resolution in Biomedical Text," 2017 AMIA Annual Symposium Distinguished Paper Award for the paper titled "Combining Open-domain and Biomedical Knowledge for Topic Recognition in Consumer Health Questions," 2016 AMIA Annual Symposium Distinguished Paper Award for the paper titled "Using the Literature-Based Discovery Paradigm to Investigate Drug Mechanisms," 2007 Biography Halil Kilicoglu is an associate professor in the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His research is primarily concerned with natural language understanding, with a particular focus on biomedical text. He uses a combination of data-driven analytical techniques and knowledge-based semantic approaches to extract and organize knowledge buried in textual artifacts, with potential benefits for biomedical discovery and scholarship, and healthcare outcomes. Kilicoglu earned his PhD in computer science from Concordia University in 2012. Prior to joining the iSchool faculty, he worked as a staff scientist at the U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, where he led the Semantic Knowledge Representation project.
