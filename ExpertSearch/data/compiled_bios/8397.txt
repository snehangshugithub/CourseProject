Contact information Office: PHY 251 Phone: 519 888-4567 ext. 42932 Email: nafshordi@uwaterloo.ca Website:https://nafshordi.wordpress.com/ Expertise Astrophysics Cosmology Physics of Gravity Research Dr. Afshordi has a comprehensive and ambitious research program which spans a wide area, ranging from Astrophysics and Cosmology to Fundamental Physics, and includes a diverse spectrum of observational,numerical, and analytic components. The program aims at connecting deep questionsand mysteries in fundamental physics to novel observational results and/or techniques, which can beused to shed light on the true nature of the laws that govern our Universe. The areas that he and his groupare currently focused on are: Phenomenology of Dark Energy, cosmological modificationsof General Relativity,and large scale structure of the Universe Distribution of Dark Matter on small scales and novel windows for Dark Matter detection Observational consequences of Lorentz-violating theories of Quantum Gravity, and approaches to the Cosmological (non-) Constant Problem Cosmic initial conditions, and connections to the foundations of Gravity and Quantum Mechanics Missing baryon problem, and observational probes of intergalactic plasma Physics of Neutron Stars, Black Holes, and Accretion Disks Teaching PHYS275, Planets PHYS703, Introduction to Quantum Field Theory PHYS781, Fundamentals of Astrophysics SCI238, Introductory Astronomy Highlighted Publications Universal clustering of dark matter in phase space Jesus Zavala,Niayesh Afshordi.
