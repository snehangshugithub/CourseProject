He obtained his BS and MS from University of Science and Technology of China in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and PhD from University of Hamburg at Germany in 2006. He was appointed as a Research Associate by Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois in 2007 to work on the Dzero experiment at the Tevatron collider and silicon detector R&D for future collider experiments. Dr. Ye joined UIC in 2012. Currently he is working on the STAR (Solenoidal Tracker At RHIC) experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in Upton, New York to study the properties of the matter produced in high energy heavy ion collisions and the nucleon spin structure. His physics interests include heavy flavor quark production mechanism and dynamics, and development of silicon detector technology for future nuclear and particle experiments.
