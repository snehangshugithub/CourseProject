To advance this mandate, the Center has built a community of leading scholars who undertake real estate-related research. The Working Papers series is made up of research undertaken by the Center's Affiliated Faculty and Fellows, who join the Center from departments throughout the UCLA campus, including management, economics, law, public policy, urban planning, public health, engineering, architecture and geography. Working papers are the first step to published research, and the purpose of the series is to widely distribute the results of high-quality research. At regular intervals the Ziman Center prepares research briefs that provide insights into research to the wider real estate community. 2021 WP # Title Author(s) 15 Urban Exceptionalism: Is the Social-Spatial Structure of Cities a Mark of Distinction or Commonality?
