Calif. Berkeley, 2008-2011 Postdoctoral Researcher, Department of Nuclear Engineering, UC-Berkeley, 2005-2008 Research Interests: Donghua Xus research centers around thermally driven and/or irradiation induced kinetic processes in materials. He is particularly interested in materials microstructural and microchemical evolution under neutral or charged particle irradiation, and formation, devitrification and properties of amorphous metals/alloys (a.k.a. metallic glasses). His research involves both computation (cluster dynamics, object kinetic Monte Carlo, nucleation and growth theory, etc.) and experiments (melting, casting, annealing, microstructural characterization etc.) Future Students Current Students Alumni and Friends Industry and Partners Faculty and Staff Support MIME Contact Info School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering 204 Rogers Hall 2000 SW Monroe Avenue Oregon State University Corvallis, OR 97331-6001 Fax: 541-737-2600 info-mime@oregonstate.edu Undergrad Student Services Phone: 541-737-7009 Graduate Student Services Phone: 541-737-3441 mime.gradinfo@oregonstate.edu Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin Land Acknowledgement Copyright 2021 Oregon State University Disclaimer ABOUT US Overview Accreditation News RESEARCH Overview Research Areas Research Facilities PEOPLE Faculty Research Areas of Research Excellence Faculty & Staff Directory Graduate Students Class Composites Careers INDUSTRY RELATIONS Overview Events Calendar Capstone Design Join Our Mailing List Contact Us STUDENT INFORMATION Undergrad Advising Graduate Advising Undergrad Financial Info Graduate Financial Info MIME Student Groups
