Electromagnetic inverse scattering of complicated material-compositions and complicated shapes. In particular metals and lossy materials combined to enhance or reduce scattered beams for both identifications and disguise. Material properties identifications including non-linear response using ADE (auxiliary differential equation) for each term in the materials permittivity function.
