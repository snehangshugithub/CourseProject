Verlinde Professor of PhysicsDepartment ChairPhone:609-258-5585 Email Address: verlinde@Princeton.EDU Assistant:Janelle Jupiter Office Location:350 Jadwin HallWebsite:physics.princeton.edu/~verlinde/ My research field is string theory. I am interested in all its many aspects: its mathematical foundations and non-perturbative formulations, as well as its applications to particle physics, gauge theory, black hole physics, and cosmology. The focus of my most recent research is the quantum theory of black hole horizons, and its connection to quantum information theory and entanglement.
