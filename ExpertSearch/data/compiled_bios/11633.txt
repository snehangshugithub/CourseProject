Dr. Musgraves research focuses on adaptive and morphing systems operating in fluidic environments, in particular systems subject to dynamic fluid-structure interactions. These systems are inherently multi-physical and sit at the intersection of structures, hydro/aerodynamics, mechatronics, smart materials, and controls. To investigate these systems, Dr. Musgraves research emphasizes a combination of experimentation and analytic/reduced-order modeling. Applications of interest include bio-inspired underwater propulsion, underwater robotics, embedded sensing, and compliant aerospace systems. Prior to joining the University of Florida in the Fall of 2021, Dr. Musgrave was a research scientist at the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in the Naval Center for Space Technology. At NRL, he was a Jerome Karles Fellow and received early career funding in the area of bio-inspired underwater propulsion. Dr. Musgrave is a DAAD Scholar, having held a post-baccalaureate research position at the Technical University of Munich.
