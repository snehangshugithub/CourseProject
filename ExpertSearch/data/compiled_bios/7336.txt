M.D., Yale University, USA, 1987. B.A., Mathematics, Wesleyan University, USA, 1979. Research Interests Research in my group focuses on integral equation methods for electromagnetics, acoustics, elasticity, plasma physics and fluid dynamics. We are developing fast solvers for each of these applications in complex geometry, and extending analysis-based fast solvers to kernel-based methods in statistical inference. Selected Publications L.
