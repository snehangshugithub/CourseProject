Aerospace Engineering, West Virginia UniversityM.S. Aerospace Engineering, Pennsylvania State UniversityPh.D. Aerospace Engineering, University of Michigan Prof. Eric Loth is the Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and serves as the Rolls-Royce Commonwealth Professor of Engineering. He has received honors and awards from NASA and the National Science Foundation while also being named a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, and of Cambridge University. Dr. Loth has given invited talks at Cambridge, Penn, Princeton, Oxford, Harvard, and MIT. In 2017, his project team was invited to US Congress to discuss their new the $3.7M project on extreme-scale morphing wind turbines. This ambitious project has received coverage by NBC, Scientific American, Popular Science, Yahooand MIT Technology Review.
