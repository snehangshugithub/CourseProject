Allen School for Computer Science and Engineering Associate Professor, Department of Genome Sciences Adjunct Associate Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering Adjunct Associate Professor, Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education suinlee@cs.washington.edu Website Interests: Machine learning, computational biology, clinical informatics Background: Prof. Su-In Lee is an Associate Professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering and in the Genome Sciences Department, and Adjunct Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and in the Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education at the University of Washington. She completed her PhD in 2009 at Stanford University with Prof. Daphne Koller in the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Before joining the UW in 2010, she was a visiting professor in the Computational Biology Department at Carnegie Mellon University. Research: Prof. Lees research seeks to develop interpretable machine learning techniques to learn from big data: (1) how the human genome or protein works, (2) how to improve healthcare, and (3) how to treat challenging and complex diseases such as cancer and Alzheimers disease.
