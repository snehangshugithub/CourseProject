His research interests include sustainable energy management, reaction engineering, the exploration of alternative energy and the optimization of carbon dioxide capture processes. Dr. Croiset and his team have collaborated with CanmetENERGY, Natural Resources Canada to understand, simulate and economically evaluate 3 carbon dioxide capture processes: post-combustion, pre-combustion and oxy-fuel combustion. His goal is to understand the dynamic behaviour of carbon dioxide capture plants, and to develop designs of power plants with carbon dioxide capture. Professor Croiset is also interested in multi-period optimization to predict the impact of new technologies, such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, on the fleet of power generation in Ontario over the next few decades. Prof. Croisets interest in alternative energy sources has led him to model the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and understand charge transfer and reaction kinetics in the SOFC. This is in an effort to reduce the operating temperature range from 800-100oC to 600-700oC, as high temperatures result in fuel cell instability. His approach is to use a ceria-based electrolyte and develop carbon and sulfur tolerant anodes on metal supported SOFC. Another area of Prof. Croisets research work is in syngas/hydrogen production from natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethanol and glycerol. He is also producing high pressure hydrogen from ethanol, desulphurization using advance solvents and designing reactors and systems to produce methanol. In 2010 and 2011, he received a grant of $7,425 from the Ontario Centres of Excellence for the preliminary design of Elementa Green Methanol Waste-to-Methanol Process (Elementa). In addition to his research work, Prof. Croiset has contributed to the book Environmentally Conscious Fossil Energy Production.Research InterestsReaction EngineeringSolid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC)Syngas/Hydrogen productionCarbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS)Process simulationReactions in Supercritical WaterGreen Reaction EngineeringLarge scale optimization of energy systemsCO2 capture from large point sourcesEducation1995, Doctorate, Physical Chemistry, University of Orleans, CNRS - Laboratoire de Combustion et Systemes Reactifs1992, Diplome d'Etude Approfondie, Post graduate diploma before completing a Ph.D., Combustion Sciences, University of Orleans1992, Engineer Diploma, Thermal Engineering, School of Energy and Materials, University of Orleans.Courses*CHE 102 - Chemistry for EngineersTaught in 2017, 2018, 2019CHE 314 - Chemical Reaction EngineeringTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020CHE 483 - Group Design ProjectTaught in 2021CHE 499 - Elective Research ProjectTaught in 2021CHE 602 - Chemical Reactor AnalysisTaught in 2020CHE 755 - Res Tpcs in Electrochem.
