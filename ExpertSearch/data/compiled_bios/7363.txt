B.S., Physics, Michigan State University, USA, 2001. Research Interests My present focus is on fluid dynamics at small scales, and in particular, fluctuating hydrodynamics. My research combines traditional computational fluid dynamics with nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and applied stochastic analysis. Applications of interest include flows at micro and nano scales typical of new microfluidic, nanofluidic and microelectromechanical devices; biological systems such as lipid membranes, Brownian molecular motors, nanopores; as well as processes where the effect of fluctuations is amplified by strong non-equilibrium effects , such as combustion of lean flames, capillary dynamics, hydrodynamic instabilities, and others.
