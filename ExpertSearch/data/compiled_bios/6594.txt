We emphasize the design of materials with modular interfaces that can be controlled at atomically precise length scales to study and overcome contemporary challenges in electrochemical energy conversion and quantum electronics. Our group synthesizes and isolates atomically thin inorganic crystals, deterministically assembles these 2D layers into novel multicomponent materials, and quantitatively interrogates the discrete architectures as constituents of electrochemical and electronic devices. To achieve our goals, we leverage solid-state and solution-phase methodologies, as well as chemical and electrochemical deposition techniques for materials synthesis. We use state-of-the-art micromanipulation and nanofabrication tools for the preparation of mesoscopic structures, and employ a range of optical spectroscopy, scanning-electrochemical, electron microscopy, and low-temperature quantum magnetotransport probes to measure the (electro)chemical and physical properties at individual devices. Currently open research projects include mechanism-guided electrocatalyst discovery for fuel-forming and fuel-consuming reactions in electrolyzers and fuel cells; ion insertion and transport reactions of two-dimensional heterointerfaces for energy storage and to create novel quantum materials; and the electro-chemical control of lightmatter interactions and topological phases in 2D semiconductors and semimetals.
