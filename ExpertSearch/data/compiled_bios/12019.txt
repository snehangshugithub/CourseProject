He obtained a PhD in Biorobotics Science and Engineering jointly offered by Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna and IMT Lucca (Italy) with a thesis about the decoding of neural signals for the control of robotic arm prostheses. He was a post-doc at Essex in 2008 working on the EPSRC BCI-Mouse project. From 2010, he worked for three years as post-doc at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts Institute of Technology specializing on statistical analysis of point processes (stochastic processes representing discrete events in time) applied to heartbeat series and neural spike trains (see http://users.neurostat.mit.edu/lciti/ ). In November 2012, he joined the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering at the University of Essex as Lecturer. In October 2016 he become a Reader in the same School, then a Professor in 2019.
