He joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern in 1985 and served as the director of the universitys Communications and Digital Signal Processing Center from 1990 to 1992.Since 1996, he has been the director of the ECE Capstone Design Program and its associated laboratory. He has served as associate editor of two major journals. Currently, he is the associate editor of IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Magazine and serves on the conference editorial board of the IEEE Control Systems Society.Professor Shafai has also been a member of the organizing committees for various international and IEEE-sponsored conferences, such as CDC, ACC, CCTA, and WAC. He has published one book and more than 200 journal articles and conference papers, and has been the recipient of several honors and awards. His research interests include robust stability and control of multivariable systems, observer theory, identification and estimation, fault detection, time-delay systems, distributed control, robotics and motion control, adaptive signal processing in control, and communications.EducationPhD, Electrical Engineering, George Washington University, 1985MS, Electrical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich, Switzerland, 1978BS, Electrical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich, Switzerland, 1976Honors & AwardsAssociate Editor, Systems Man and CyberneticsMember of Program Committee IEEE CCTA 2020Senior Life Member, Institute of Electrical and Electronics EngineersLifetime Achievement Award from World Automation Congress (WAC) 2018Certificate of Appreciation for Technical Seminar Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Young ProfessionalsProfessional AffiliationsAssociate Editor, Editorial Board and Program Chair of ISIAC-WACSenior Life Member, Institute of Electrical and Electronics EngineersLifetime Achievement Award from World Automation Congress Toggle Accordion Research Research OverviewControl Systems and Signal Processing; Robust and Optimal Control, Positive Dynamic Systems, Fault Detection, Observer Theory, Robotics and Distributed Control of Multi-Agent Systems, Control of Biological SystemsDepartment Research Areas Communications, Control & Signal Processing Power Electronics, Systems & Controls Robotics Toggle Accordion Publications Selected PublicationsB.

But theres a problem with this commercially available, assembly-required small copter: Its difficult to transport. So a team of Northeasternelectrical and computer [] Apr 16, 2010Mind Controlled Remote VehicleECE students Saumitro Dasgupta, Mike Fanton, Jonathan Pham, and Mike Willard, built a brain interface to navigate a mobile robot remotely. The team won first place in the senior capstone project competition.
