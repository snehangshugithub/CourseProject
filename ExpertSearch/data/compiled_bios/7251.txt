Recently, he has been teaching and developing the innovative course Electronics Design, in which students learn to design and debug circuits using a portable "workbench in a backpack" in place of the traditional fixed labs. Earlier, he created the course Engineering Analysis 3: System Dynamics, which is taken by almost all first-year students in the school of engineering. EA3 is part of Northwestern's signature Engineering First curriculum, which engages undergraduate students in the concepts and experience of engineering from the beginning of freshman year. He also teaches a Mechatronics Projects course, and offers walk-in assistance to many students and teams doing mechatronics-related independent projects.
