Thus, FMRP is a molecular entry point for understanding normal brain function. FMRP is an RNA binding protein that binds ~4% of brain mRNAs and regulates their expressioneither enhancing or suppressing translation by an unknown mechanism. Bursts of protein translation are required for normal development and neuronal function but it is unknown how this process is regulated. We identified the RNA helicase MOV10 as a novel interactor of FMRP. MOV10 is elevated in developing brain and is required for viability as well as normal dendritic arborization and mouse behavior. Our goal is to understand how these RNA binding proteins function to facilitate learning and memory.
