Dr. Samuels research broadly spans surface transportation human factors, healthcare human factors and safety. Dr. Samuel utilizes a variety of experimental techniques to measure human performance and study human behavior. The core theme of his work is centered around the etiology of crashes (or errors) or the study of crash (error) causation. The goal is to advance user safety by accounting for the limitations of both, infrastructure and interface device design. Specifically, Sibys research deals with: - Road User (drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists) safety - Caregiver Behavior and Medical Errors - Autonomous vehicles, Connected vehicles and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) - Design and assessment of Traffic Control Devices, Roadway Infrastructure and Automotive Interfaces - Application of Virtual Environments for Rehabilitation and Occupational Therapy. - Development and evaluation of population-specific, cognitive Training Interventions (novice drivers, older drivers aged 65 and above, pedestrians, special population with ADHD and mild cognitive impairments) - Measurement of Driver Distraction, Fatigue, Mental Workload and Situation Awareness.Research InterestsSimulation & Virtual Reality/Augmented RealityNovice and Older Driver TrainingPredictive & Conceptual Modeling of BehaviourEye trackingAttention & CognitionPerceptionHuman-Centered Artificial IntelligenceDecision MakingAgingAutomotive Human factorsAutonomous and Connected Vehicles & Intelligent Transportation SystemsCaregiver Behaviours & ErrorsAssistive & Automotive InterfacesVulnerable Road User Safety (Pedestrians & Bicyclists)Motorcyclist SafetySpecial Populations (ADHD & Dementia)Traffic Control Devices & Roadway Infrastructure DesignEducation2014, Doctorate, Industrial Engineering & Operations Research, University of Massachusetts Amherst2009, Bachelor's, Electrical & Electronics Engineering, National Institute of Technology KarnatakaCourses*BME 411 - Optimization & Num MethodsTaught in 2020SYDE 411 - Optimization and Num MethodsTaught in 2020SYDE 542 - Interface DesignTaught in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021SYDE 642 - Cognitive Engineering MethodsTaught in 2019, 2020, 2021SYDE 740 - Topics in Human SystemsTaught in 2019, 2021* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsSchneider, C., Hajiseyedjavadi, F., Tainter, F., Knodler, M., Zhang, J., Romoser, M.R.E., Samuel, S., & Fisher, D.L., Measuring the Applicability of Intersection-Based Older Driver Training Programs, Transportation Research Record, 2674(9), 2020, 878 - 886Samuel, S., Yamani, Y., & Fisher, D.L., Understanding Drivers Latent Hazard Anticipation in Partially Automated Vehicle Systems, International Journal of Human Factors & Ergonomics, 7(3), 2020, 282 - 296Samuel, S., Yahoodik, S., Yamani, Y., Valluru, K., & Fisher, D.
