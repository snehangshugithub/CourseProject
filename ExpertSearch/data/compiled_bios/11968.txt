He employs a wide range of tools including field investigations, laboratory experiments and mathematical modeling to understand the complex behaviour of these systems. He leads the leads the Groundwater Geochemistry Remediation Grouptogether with Carol Ptacek. Contact informationOffice: EIT 5004 Phone: 519-888-4567, ext.84878Email: blowes@uwaterloo.ca Website: Groundwater Geochemistry and Remediation Group Expertise Behaviour and transport of groundwater contamination, includingmetals, metalloids, pathogens, nutrients and emerging contaminants in groundwater Remediation technologies including permeable reactive barriers Monitoring techniques such as non-traditional stable isotopes Geochemical processes at mining wastes, including acid rock drainage Reactive transport modelling Research The long-term goal of my research program is to develop improved techniques for the prediction, remediation and prevention of groundwater contamination derived from mine wastes and other sources of dissolved metals. My research program includes three principal components, studies of the mechanisms of contaminant release, transport and attenuation; development and application of numerical models to describe these processes; and development of new techniques for the prevention and remediation of contaminated groundwater.
