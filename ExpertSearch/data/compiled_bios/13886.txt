Wilson Sherman Fairchild Professor of Neuroscience and Picower Scholar; Associate Department Head for Education, Brain & Cognitive Sciences Matthew Wilson studies rodent learning and memory by recording and manipulating the activity of neurons during behavior and sleep. 617-253-2046 Phone 46-5233 Office mwilson@mit.edu Email Lab Website Education PhD, 1991, California Institute of Technology BS, 1983, Electrical Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Research Summary Our laboratory studies the neural processes within the hippocampus and neocortex that enable memories to form and persist over time. We use a technique that allows us to simultaneously record the activity of hundreds of individual neurons across multiple brain regions in freely behaving animals. When combined with genetic, pharmacological and behavioral manipulations, these recordings allow us to gain a mechanistic understanding of how animals learn and remember.
