Her goal is for robots to autonomously generate their behavior in a way that moves beyond functionality and formally accounts for interaction with humans. This combines optimal control, machine learning, and cognitive science, with applications in collaborative manipulation and autonomous driving. Anca got her PhD in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University on planning intent-expressive robot motion.
