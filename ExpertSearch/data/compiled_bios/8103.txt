The unique phase behavior of these protein- and peptide-based materials is being exploited to produce novel nano- and micro-structured materials with potential therapeutics uses in cardiovascular disease, wound healing, tendon repair, and treatment of various arthroses. These projects exploit the control of polymer architecture afforded by the use of proteins and peptides, which enables nuanced control of assembly; students in the group employ a varied combination of materials synthesis and characterization methods. Protein engineering strategies are used to produce designed protein materials; biochemical methods are employed for protein purification; chemical methods are used to modify the proteins with appropriate ligands. Immunochemical assays, scattering methods, optical microscopy, electron microscopy, and cell culture are also utilized as appropriate to characterize these polymeric systems. The production of these unique macromolecular systems will expedite the development of new biomaterials and therapeutic strategies.

In the case of chronic wounds, local inflammation and/or infection can hijack these normal repair processes, preventing repair and resulting in significantly increased morbidity rates. Our approach to addressing these challenges involves peptide-based delivery vehicles that harness ECM interactions to induce high-efficiency drug delivery and improved cellular uptake. To this end, we are producing a variety of collagen-modified nanoparticles and demonstrating their interactions with ECM components for delivery of macromolecular and small-molecule drugs. Preliminary data suggest that these interactions improve the duration of cargo delivery in a variety of in vivo models. Elastomeric materials for regenerative medicine Inspired by the outstanding mechanical properties of natural resilin, the highly elastomeric protein in insects, we have engineered a library of resilin-like polypeptides (RLP) for applications in regenerative medicine. Through the introduction of specific biomimetic amino acid sequences, the RLPs are endowed with proteolytic, cell binding and heparin sequestration properties that mimic the function of natural tissues. These RLPs can be cross-linked through small molecule cross-linkers, as well as PEG macromers, utilizing a variety of different chemistries. Our RLP hydrogels have been shown to be highly resilient, highly cytocompatible, and capable of injection/implantation in vivo. Currently, we are investigating how to harness the phase-separation of this unique class of polypeptides to mimic the formation of membraneless organelles in cells, to produce materials capable of actuation, and also to develop microstructured hydrogels that may have use in the development of multicellular intestinal epithelium for the treatment of intestinal pathologies. Polymeric nanostructures The aim of this project area is to use polymer-peptide hybrid materials that show controlled assembly that can be used both as vehicles for delivery and models of protein aggregation. Both peptide and polymer components provide functionality to the materials, which are produced by a variety of controlled polymerization and click chemistry methods. Peptide-polymer conjugates, comprising peptides from structural proteins such as elastin and collagen, have demonstrated (triggered) assembly into nanoparticles and platelets. We anticipate great versatility in these approaches, as a wide variety of different peptide segments could potentially be employed to fine-tune the properties and functionality of the hybrid material. Redox-sensitive hydrogels Hydrogels, composed of hydrophilic polymers that are lightly cross-linked, have a high degree of porosity that allows encapsulation of therapeutics and also high water content that contributes to biocompatibility. In this project, we are producing polymer-based hydrogels via thiol-maleimide Michael-type addition reactions. By taking advantage of the surface versatility of the hydrogels and the tunable reversibility of engineered Michael-type adducts pioneered in our group, the materials can be engineered for targeted chemotherapies, for temporally controlled protein delivery, and to encapsulate nanoparticles for simultaneous release of multiple cargo molecules. These hydrogels can also be processed into microparticles or with functional groups that are available for drug conjugation.
