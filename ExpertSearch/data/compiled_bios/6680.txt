Trained as both a physician and engineer at Harvard, MIT, and Brown University, Bhatia leverages tiny technologies of miniaturization to yield inventions such as human microlivers that model human drug metabolism and liver disease, as well as responsive nanoparticles and nanoporous materials that can be engineered to diagnose, study, and treat a variety of diseases, including cancer. She and her trainees have launched multiple biotechnology companies to improve human health. As a prolific inventor and passionate advocate for diversity in science and engineering, Bhatia has received many honors including the Lemelson-MIT Prize, known as the Oscar for inventors, and the Heinz Medal for groundbreaking inventions and advocacy for women in STEM fields. She is aHoward Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, theDirector of the Marble Center for Cancer Nanomedicineat the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, and an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Science, the National Academy of Inventors, and Brown Universitys Board of Trustees.

Fung Young Investigator Award of the American College of Clinical Pharmacology Brown Engineering Alumni Medal Merkin Fellow, Broad Institute Harvard Medical School Diversity Award Harvard-MIT Thomas McMahon Mentoring Award Research Interests Nano-based Drugs and Delivery Mechanisms Activity-based Diagnostics Hepatic Tissue Engineering and Disease Our laboratory conducts research at the intersection of engineering, medicine, and biology to develop novel platforms for understanding, diagnosing, and treating human disease. Our long-term goals are to improve cellular therapies for liver disease, develop microtechnology tools to systematically study living cells, and design multifunctional nanomaterial systems which assemble and communicate to interrogate and coordinately treat cancer. We have developed technologies for interfacing living cells with synthetic systems, enabling new applications in tissue regeneration, stem cell differentiation, medical diagnostics and drug delivery. One such platform applies microfabrication technologies used in semiconductor manufacturing to organize cells of different types to produce a tissue with emergent properties. These efforts have produced human microlivers which model human drug metabolism, drug-induced liver disease, and interaction with human pathogens, thereby establishing high-throughput models that fully replicate the life cycles of hepatitis C and liver-stage human malaria, and are being used for drug testing, discovery, and tissue engineering applications. We are also involved in a multidisciplinary effort to develop nanomaterials as tools for biological studies and as multifunctional agents for cancer therapies. By bridging the unique electromagnetic properties of nanomaterials with advances in bioconjugate chemistry, photonics, and phage display we aim to develop intelligent systems for tumor therapy and biomolecular detection. Our interest centers around nanoparticles and nanoporous materials that can be designed to perform complex tasks such as home to a tumor, sense changes in cells and tissues, enhance imaging, recruit complementary nanoparticles and signal pathways, and trigger the release of a targeted, therapeutic payload. Our lab philosophy also includes a strong emphasis on the professional development of our trainees, and also a commitment to promoting diversity in STEM training and research, as well as communication of science to the public.
