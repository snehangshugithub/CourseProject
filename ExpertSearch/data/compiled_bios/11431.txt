Prior to this appointment, he was an assistant professor at the University of South Florida. Education Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering, Arizona State University, 2012 B.S. in Statistics, University of Science and Technology of China, 2007 Research Statement Dr. Shuai Huangs research is driven by challenging data analytics problems, emphasizes innovation in statistics for problem solving, and targets system-level decision-making and quality improvement. He develops methodologies for modeling, monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis of complex systems, such as the brain connectivity networks, cyber-physics systems, disease progressions (e.g., Alzheimers, Type 1 Diabetes, Surgical Site Infection), and manufacturing systems (e.g., MEMS surface topography). He also develops novel statistical and data mining models to integrate the heterogeneous datasets such as neuroimaging, genomics, proteomics, laboratory tests, demographics, and clinical variables, for facilitating scientific discoveries in biomedical research and better decision-making in clinical practices.
