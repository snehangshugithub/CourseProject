The thalamus also acts as an intermediary for cortico-cortical communication. Our research aims to understand the anatomical and electrophysiological bases of these processes using neuroanatomical and immunohistochemical light and electron microscopic methods and single- and multi-unit electrophysiological recordings with activation of specific neuromodulatory projections. Thalamo-cortical neural circuitry is also involved in the generation of normal brain rhythms that occur across the sleep wake cycle and in the pathological rhythms of absence (petit mal) epilepsy. Absence seizures can be triggered by flashing visual stimuli, and we are studying the thalamic mechanisms that lead to the onset of these phototriggered seizures.
