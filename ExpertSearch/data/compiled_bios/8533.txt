Research: I am interested in patient experience how patients encounter, seek out and interpret information to help manage their condition, and especially, how patients understandings and cognitive representations of health and wellness change over time in the context of chronic illness management. I am also engaged in research that employs text and visual analytics to explore patterns in digital traces, or user-generated data about health, from social media including Reddit, discussion forums, and Internet-delivered behavioral health interventions. Understanding patient needs, preferences, and behaviors can lead to more effective tailoring and personalization of health information and education. I am accepting new MS and PhD students.
