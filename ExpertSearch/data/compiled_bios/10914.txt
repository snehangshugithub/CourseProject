His main research interest is in physics beyond the standard model. He has studied models related to the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking, including supersymmetric theories, theories with extra dimensions, little Higgs theories etc. He also investigates the collider signatures of these models and how to identify the correct theory by measuring the properties of the new particles produced at colliders. He is also interested in models of dark matter and the associated phenomenology.
