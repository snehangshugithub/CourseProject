Professor Leonenkos research program employs SPM methods to study biophysics of lipids and lipid-protein interactions, the role of structural changes and physical properties of lipid template in controlling biological processes and diseases. Investigation of Lipid Membrane as an ImportantPart of Every Living Cell Amyloid fibrils are insoluble protein aggregates that associated with several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease. Professor Leonenkos research team studies the structure and physical properties of the model and cell membrane in relation amyloid fibril formation and toxicity. These studies will aid in understanding of complex mechanism of amyloidoses and will help to develop novel methods for early detection and prevention of Alzheimers disease. Additional Research Projects Professor Leonenkos research group will also investigate the following: structure and function of pulmonary surfactant and interaction of surfactant with nanoparticles application of lipid films in biomedical nanotechnology and biosensor development interactions of nanoparticles with lipid membrane and development of novel scanning probe force microscopy methods and novel applications of these methods for bio-and -nanotechnologies Teaching PHYS280, Introduction to Biophysics PHYS461, Nanophysics NANO702, Nanotechnology Tools Highlighted Publications Cordova G., Lee B.,Leonenko, Z.
