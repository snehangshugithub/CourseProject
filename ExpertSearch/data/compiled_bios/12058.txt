He undertook his Ph.D. study to develop intelligent systems for screening of disorders at the Centre of Intelligent Signal and Imaging Research, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Malaysia. His Ph.D.s proposed work was approved for funding of 0.5 million US dollars after the external review of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Zulfiqar obtained a Master's degree in Computational Mathematics from the University of the Punjab and a Master's degree in System Engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore. He served in the School of Computing at Ulster University from 2018 to 2020 as a Research Fellow in BTIIC (British Telecom Ireland Innovation Centre), where he worked on various funded projects including Smarter Customer Analytics, Intelligent Process Analytics, Adaptive and Autonomic Systems. He also served King Saud University, Riyadh from 2010 to 2018 as a Senior Researcher where he submitted and completed three funded projects, reviewed and approved by AAAS and King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology. Continued with Ph.D. research interest, Zulfiqar has developed various intelligent systems using machine learning approaches for the screening of disorders. Secure transmission of medical data (speech/image) collected through the Internet of Things using encryption and zero-watermarking is also included in his area of expertise. Recently, a project " Cloud-Based Privacy Protected Computer-Aided Diagnosis System for Routine Breast Cancer Screening" has been accepted for funding. He has also provided consultancy in various funded projects. He has published extensively in the domain of speech/speaker recognition, biomedical engineering, security and privacy in healthcare applications, and multimedia forensics.
