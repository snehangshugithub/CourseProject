I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, where I was advised by Prof. Steve Marcus and Prof. Rance Cleaveland. My research is in the broad area of cyber-physical systems, with an emphasis on using techniques from control, reinforcement learning, formal methods, and game theory.Educational & Professional Experience Postdoctoral Research Associate, Network Security Lab, University of Washington, Seattle, 2018-2021 Ph.D., Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, 2018 M.S., Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, 2016 M.Tech., Systems and Control Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India, 2011 B.Tech., Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, India, 2009 Recent PublicationsPlease see my Google Scholar.Research InterestsMy research focus is in the fields of feedback-driven machine learning and software-defined secure verification in order to reason about the behavior of autonomous cyber and cyber-physical systems. I adopt a multidisciplinary approach that establishes an interplay between fundamental techniques from control, machine learning, game theory, and formal methods. My goal is to integrate and interpret feedback and data generated by cyber systems to develop viable algorithms for real-world applications that are scalable and provide provable performance guarantees.Selected Awards & Honors Best Paper Finalist, International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS), 2020 Outstanding Teaching Assistant, Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, 2017-18 Jacob K.
