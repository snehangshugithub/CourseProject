Sheis an extensive collaborator in the pediatric, neurology, pathology, and neurobiologyfields. Elizabethhasexpertise in (1) developing nanoparticles that are capable of focally targeting disease tissue and specific cells within the brain, while providing sustained action of a therapeutic agent; (2) evaluating uptake and transport of nanoparticles in healthy and diseased perinatal/neonatal models of inflammation-induced brain injury; (3) live animal imaging, live tissue imaging, and complex immunofluorescent staining and imaging; (4) developing neurobehavioral assessments of nanoparticle efficacy in neuroinflammation-mediated animal models of brain disease, in 3 different species (rabbit, rat, mouse); and (5) systems-level analysis of inflammation through characterization of glial cell phenotype and motility, mRNA levels, behavior, and blood-brain barrier impairment. Education Ph.D. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, 2012 B.S. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, North Carolina State University, 2006 Previous appointments Hartwell Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow, Anesthesiology & Critical Care Medicine, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, 2013 2015, Research Statement We integrate in vitro to in vivo models with imaging, molecular biology, and data science tools to extract statistically relevant information that captures changes in the brain that might influence how a therapeutic behaves. We have used the information gathered from application of these tools to design nano-based therapeutics that can achieve region and cell-specific targeting in the brain for improved neuroprotection in a variety of brain injury models.
