He was a National Research Council post-doctoral fellow at the Naval Research Laboratory and a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland prior to joining the University of Florida. His research is focused on understanding the dynamics of multiphase and chemically reactive flows using numerical simulation techniques. Applications of this work include dust explosions, detonation initiation, detonation engines, and the combustion of solid propellants and metal particles. Education Ph.D., 2011, The Pennsylvania State University Teaching Interests Fluid mechanics, combustion, heat transfer, thermodynamics, computational fluid dynamics Research Interests Combustion and multiphase flows including detonation initiation and propagation, dust explosions, propulsion, spray combustion, solid propellant and metal particle combustion.
