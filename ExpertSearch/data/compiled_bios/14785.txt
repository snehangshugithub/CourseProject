She has degrees from St Lawrence University, McGill University, and the University of Massachusetts and was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Cape Town. Her early research in diamonds, anorthosites and metasomatism of the Proterozoic mantle led to work in the minerals industry and subsequent roles developing the fields of quantitative mineralogy and geomet understanding the nature of geologic and mineral variability for more effective mineral operations. Before coming to Cornell, Karin was Director of the Advanced Mineralogy Research Center at Colorado School of Mines, developing new applications in quantitative mineralogy for minerals, energy, environmental and planetary science. She is a consultant in geomet and has worked and lectured in Southern Africa, Australia and the Americas. Karin is a Fellow of the Society of Economic Geologists, Chair of the Sustainable Development Committee for the Society of Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration, an active member of Women in Mining and an Emeritus board member for the Colorado Womens Education Foundation.Research InterestsAs the Wold Family Professor, Karins focus areas relate to helping transform the minerals and energy industries be more innovative, effective and sustainable while providing the essential materials and power needed by global society. This work involves building interdisciplinary approaches that directly link geological variability in the subsurface with positive business outcomes to reduce the uncertainty and risk in mineral projects. Technical derisking of projects integrates the data from characterization of geological materials with process characteristics and downstream sustainability impacts. Research into the micron- to meter scale elemental and mineral deportment of ores, energy materials, and their waste products helps to uncover both deleterious components as well as potentially valuable materials that may be naturally upgradeable. To do this work requires cross-functional approaches and new data-centric 3D models, and we are building partnerships with industry and financial institutions to develop this space. Corollary projects include developing geomet-economic models, quantifying the benefits of improved geological understanding in mining, geological variability in diamond deposits, mineral characterization of mine waste, mineralogy of beach sands, Adirondack geology applied to Cornells Earth Source Heat geothermal project, and landfill mining.Energy, Mineral and Water ResourcesSelected PublicationsOlson Hoal, K., (in press, 2020), The importance of geomet in resource estimation, in Koutz, F., Ed., Geological Society of Nevada Symposium Proceedings Volume, RenoOlson Hoal, K.
