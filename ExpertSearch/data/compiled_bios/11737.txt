Electrical Engineering, University of Tehran 2007 "We develop new systems biology approaches to understand fundamental mechanisms of immune regulation and dysregulation, with an ultimate objective of identifying strategies to design and improve immunotherapies." Sepideh Dolatshahi, PhD, Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering Research in the Dolatshahi lab combines multiplex experimental measurements with computationalmethods (including statistical machine learning, network inference, informationtheory, signal processing and kinetic-dynamic modeling) to solve problems in thecontext of cancer,infectious disease and maternal-neonatal immunology. The immune system is complex and ubiquitous. Numerous immune cell types eitherreside in a particular tissue or circulate throughout the body. Each celltype has its unique roles and approaches in sensing problems, communicatingwith other cells, and elicitingtheir immune functions. The Dolatshahi labtakes a systems approach to understand the interconnecting pathways thatcontrol immune responses spanning across multiple biological systems andscales. This understanding will enable us to optimizeimmuneresponses to confront specific issues, ranging from infectionsto cancer. By building computational models and machine-learningstrategies that integrate experimental data across various molecular andcellular scales, Dolatshahi laboratory seeks to: (1) ascertain howbiophysicalproperties of the immune factors (defined as their subclass andpost-translational modifications) determine their function, (2) uncovermechanisms responsible for dysregulation of these properties in disease states,and (3) use this knowledge to guidebiomarkers for early diseasediagnosis, patient stratification and optimized immunotherapies. Anotherkey step in translational immunotherapies is the design of maximallyinformative animal studies for reliable prediction of the outcome in humans. Tothis end,Dolatshahi lab also (4) creates predictive computationaltransfer functions to relate mechanistic models of cellular processes inanimals to those in humans. Such functions will enable inter-speciestranslation of molecules to phenotypes. Dr. Dolatshahi joins the Department of Biomedical Engineering as Assistant Professor on January 1, 2020. Her lab is looking for talented, enthusiastic and diversemembers to join their efforts. The labs priority is to provide training to highly motivated engineers and scientists who tacklereal-world problems that closely impact peoples lives - and to have fun while doing so!
