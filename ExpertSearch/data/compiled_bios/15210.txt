Using techniques such as multiple-scales, weakly nonlinear asymptotics, small scale numerical computation and large direct numerical simulations, my work is aimed at isolating the essential processes underlying natural phenomena. My goal is to choose applied problems on which mathematical analysis can have the greatest impact. In particular, it is important to use careful analysis of physical models in order to fill in the gaps which arise in large numerical simulations or to scale up the results of smaller numerical models. In recent years, my work has focused on the organization of tropical weather to generate large scale weather patterns in the tropics. This is a classic "bottom up" phenomenon, whereby the interplay of small scales (storms and the waves they generate) modify, and are modified by, the large scale winds.
