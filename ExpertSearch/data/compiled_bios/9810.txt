My current research interests relate to development of spectral methods and unsupervised & supervised deep learning approaches for analyzing high dimensional genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics and proteomics data from various modalities. I apply these methods in the context of cancer, immunobiology, brain and phylogeny studies with the aim of revealing cell specific regulatory networks and characterizing biomarkers.Education & TrainingPhDTel Aviv University (1993)Departments & OrganizationsCenter for Biomedical Data ScienceCenter for Medical InformaticsComputational Biology and BioinformaticsExperimental Pathology Graduate ProgramGenomics, Genetics, and EpigeneticsInformatics ProgramK12 Calabresi Immuno-Oncology Training Program (IOTP)Kluger LabMolecular Medicine, Pharmacology, and PhysiologyOffice of Cooperative ResearchPathologyPathology ResearchYale Cancer CenterYale Combined Program in the Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS)Yale UniversityEdit ProfileBiological and Biomedical Sciences Program (BBS)Yale UniversityNew Haven, CT 06520-8084Maps & Directions23 Eventsyou could attend in December 2021CalendarContact UsIntranetSite EditorAccessibility at YSMTerms & Privacy PolicyYale UniversityYale PhonebookPowered by Yale School of Medicine web platforms 2021 Yale University.
