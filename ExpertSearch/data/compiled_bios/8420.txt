Environmental Engineering The George Washington University, 1983 B.S. Environmental Sciences University of Virginia, 1976 ResearchInterests Our interest is in developing an end-to-end system of field-deployed sensors and fully coupled groundwater-surface water mathematical models to quantify and predict the urban hydrologic cycle and coupled biogeochemical cycles from neighborhood to regional scales. Our goal is to be able to assimilate sensor data into hydrologic and water quality models in near-real time for predicting flow paths, fluxes and stores of water and chemicals on land surfaces and in the subsurface. We work in collaboration with the NSF Baltimore Ecosystem Study Long-Term Ecological Research Site and the USGS MD-DE-DC Water Science Center. While methods are being developed using place-based research in Baltimore area, the methods are widely applicable to other urban areas. Selected Publications B. R. Rosenzweig1, P. Herreros Cantis, Y.
