Migration or cell polarization is then activated by, for example, interaction of Rho GTPases and focal adhesion complexes, and/or interactions of cadherins with p120ctn and the Rho GTPases. We are studying molecules that define the pathways of cell migration and tissue migration in zebrafish embryos. These molecules include focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin, zyxin, cadherins, p120ctn, and the Rho GTPases, Rho, Rac and cdc42. We have shown that phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is seen on tissue boundaries such as that the notochord-somite boundary and intersomitic boundaries, consistent with a role for FAK in boundary formation. We have shown using the knypek;trilobite double mutant that the polarization of FAK mRNA distribution in somite border cells is independent of internal mesenchyme cells and likely dependent on the polarization of somite border cells (Henry et al. 2000, 2001). We have also shown that the focal adhesion protein paxillin is localized in a novel manner to either adherens or tight junctions the epithelial enveloping layer of the zebrafish. FAK is also localized to these epithelial adherens or tight junctions, but is phosphorylated in a non-canonical manner, and not on Tyr-397 (Crawford et al. 2003 ). We have demonstrated the roles of p120 catenin and Rho, Rac and Cdc42 GTPases in cell polarization and the migration of presomitic mesoderm (Hsu et al., 2012). We are currently identifying the phosphorylated residues of p120 catenin that regulate cell migration or cell adhesions during early zebrafish development. One of these projects is to localize proteins that bind p120 catenin when it is phosphorylated on serine residues or tyrosine residues.
