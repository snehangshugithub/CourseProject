After a short post-doctoral period at Harvard/US and at Ecole des Mines of Paris/France, I was the youngest recipient of the European Research Council Starting/ERC Grant at the age of 24 (out of ~9,100 applicants only 300 were funded that year), which I carried out at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, between 2008-2013. In 2013 I joined the University of Arizona as an Associate Professor, and since 2017 I have been an Associate Professor and Faculty Fellow at the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department of the University of Florida, where I setup the Laboratory of Nanomaterials for Energy and Biological Applications. Education BS, Michigan Technological Univ, 2002,MPhil, Univ of Cambridge (Pembroke College), 2004,PhD, Univ of Groningen, 2005 Teaching Interests Li-ion Batteries, Energy Storage, Mechanical Design I Research Interests Katerina E. Aifantis focuses on using solid mechanics for understanding materials behavior at the nanoscale, such as dislocation-grain boundary and dislocation-graphene interactions. In addition to basic science questions, she uses her theoretical and experimental insight to predict the most promising materials systems that can be used in various applications, ranging from next generation electrodes for Li-ion batteries, to bone regeneration scaffolds and bioacompatible electrodes for deep brain stimulation.
