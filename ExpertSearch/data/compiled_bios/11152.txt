Broadly speaking, I conduct research at the intersection of marketing and consumer well-being. My work draws on research from marketing, psychology, economics, and sociology to solve real world problems consumers face. I have explored when healthy food labels make people hungry (Finkelstein & Fishbach, 2010), when negative feedback is motivating as a function of expertise (Finkelstein & Fishbach, 2012), how relationship depth impacts the provision of negative feedback (Finkelstein, Fishbach, & Tu, 2017), how risk attitudes impact medical appointment scheduling behavior (Liu et al., 2017; Finkelstein et al., 2017), how changes to vaccination policy impacts parent's vaccination behaviors for their children (Finkelstein et al., 2020; Sherman et al., in process), and the impact of choice architecture on consumers savings, organ donation, eating, and shopping decisions (McKenzie, Liersch, & Finkelstein, 2006; Cravener et al., 2015; Thomas et al., 2020). In recognition of my work, I received the American Marketing Association (AMA) Marketing and Society Special Interest Group (MASSIG) Early Career Award in 2019. I am currently on the Editorial Review Board (ERB) of the Journal for Marketing Research, the Journal of Public Policy and Marketing, the Journal of Consumer Affairs, and Appetite. I am also guest-editing a special issue on Marketing and Consumer Well-being in the journal Appetite. I was also on the ERB for the Journal of Consumer Research from 2016-2018.
