We are using Drosophila melanogaster neuroblasts, the neural stem cells in the fly as a model to study the molecular cell biology and mechanics of asymmetric stem cell division. Currently my lab is focusing on the following topics: (1) the molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment and maintenance of centrosome asymmetry and biased centrosome segregation. (2) Myosin dynamics and cleavage furrow positioning during asymmetric cell division. (3) Mechanical and biophysical mechanisms involved in ACD. To investigate these topics, we are using a combination of classical genetics, live cell imaging, superresolution imaging, molecular genetics and biophysical measurements.
