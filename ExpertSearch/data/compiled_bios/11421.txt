Biography Professor Gill has been with Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) since 1997, first as a research associate and since 2001 as a member of the faculty. He gained significant industry experience working for companies such as SBC Communications (now AT&T), Teknivent Corp., Saleskit Software and Prudential Group Health. As an undergraduate student at WashU, Professor Gill was a National Merit Scholar and graduated cum laude in English and Biology. A National Science Foundation CAREER award recipient, Professor Gill emphasizes a laboratory-based teaching approach, with personal attention to how students combine fundamentals of computer science with state-of-the-art software engineering techniques, to gain expertise and hands-on experience in designing and implementing high quality software.
