Lodish Professor of Biology and Biological Engineering; Founding Member, Whitehead Institute Before closing his lab, Harvey F. Lodish studied the development of red blood cells and the use of modified red cells for the introduction of novel therapeutics into the human body, as well as the development of brown and white fat cells. 617-258-5216 Phone WI-601C Office lodish@wi.mit.edu Email Lab Website Mary Ann Donovan Assistant 617-258-5217 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1966, Rockefeller University BS, 1962, Chemistry and Mathematics, Kenyon College Research Summary Harvey Lodish has been a leader in molecular cell biology as well as a biotechnology entrepreneur for over five decades. Much of his early research focused on the regulation of messenger RNA translation and the biogenesis of plasma membrane glycoproteins. Beginning in the 1980s, his research focused on cloning and characterizing many proteins, microRNAs, and long noncoding RNAs important for red cell development and function. His laboratory was the first to clone and sequence mRNAs encoding many hormone receptors, mammalian glucose transport proteins, and proteins important for adipose cell formation and function. He went on to identify and characterize several genes and proteins involved in insulin resistance and stress responses in adipose cells. Over the years, he has mentored hundreds of undergraduates, PhD and MD/PhD students, and postdoctoral fellows, and continues to teach award-winning undergraduate and graduate classes on biotechnology. Harvey Lodish closed his lab in 2020 and is no longer accepting students. Awards Wallace H.
