Listed below are office hours/group meetings that are open to interested students. Due to the pandemic we realize that especially for incoming students, trying to find an advisor remotely is difficult. Faculty are making themselves available during the times below so that it is a bit easier for you can get to know them and their group. If you aren't available for one of the times you are interested in, don't hesitate to reach out to the faculty directly to schedule an alternate time to meet with them.AMO Experiment(Nick Hutzler)January 15, 20211:30-2:30 pm PSThttps://caltech.zoom.us/j/8581173272Gravitational Waves(KaterinaChatziioannou)Office HoursWednesdays, 2:00-3:00pm PSThttps://caltech.zoom.us/j/6205060120Theoretical Astrophysics(Phil Hopkins)Weekly Group MeetingMondays at 1:00pm PSThttps://caltech.zoom.us/j/2701819296?pwd=QzBBSlJzK3VFdFgrZ0NQV01XejliUT09Meeting ID: 270 181 9296 Passcode: 392845214(Jim Fuller)Weekly Group MeetingFridays at 10:00am PSThttps://caltech.zoom.us/j/93696384404 Contact Us Feedback Claimed Copyright Infringement Privacy Notice Log in Caltech - The Division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy 1200 E California Blvd, Pasadena CA 91125 Unless otherwise noted, all site content 2021 California Institute of Technology
