Rezende Assistant Professor Statistical Genetics and Genomics Dr. Fernanda Rezende was born and raised in Brazil, where she earned her B.S. in Animal Sciences and her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Animal Breeding and Genetics from the University of So Paulo. She served as Animal Breeding and Genetics faculty at the Federal University of Uberlandia in Brazil for 8 years and as Postdoctoral Research Associate of Quantitative Genetics and Genomics at UF Animal Sciences Department from 2017 to 2021. As an Assistant Professor of Statistical Genetics and Genomics at the University of Florida, her major responsibilities are to develop and conduct research and teaching programs in statistical genetics, quantitative genomics, and related subject areas that ultimately benefit livestock industries. Programs Research Research: The overall goal of Dr. Rezendes program is to deepen our understanding of the complex genetic architecture of economically relevant traits, which contributes to the development of novel genomic strategies for improving animal production efficiency and sustainability via genetic selection. Her research is centered on the development and application of statistical and computational methods and bioinformatics tools to analyze and integrate high-dimensional data to better understand the connection between genetic variation at the molecular level and the expression of complex phenotypes, as well as to predict genetic merit or yet-to-be observed phenotypes. Dr. Rezendes research involves competencies in statistical genetics, quantitative genetics, quantitative genomics, and computational biology to pinpoint candidate genes and biological mechanisms underlying economically important traits and to enhance genetic prediction with a particular focus on dairy and beef cattle.
