Putnam Associate Dean for Innovation and Entrepreneurship College of Engineering Professor Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering / Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Weill Hall, Room 147 607/255-4352dap43@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyDavid Putnam joined the College of Engineering at Cornell University in 2002. Prior to joining the engineering faculty, he was an NIH postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Chemical Engineering at MIT in the laboratory of Professor Robert Langer. From 2000 until 2002, he held a joint appointment MIT and as a Scientific co-Founder of a start-up company, TransForm Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which was acquired by Johnson & Johnson in March, 2005. In 2008-2009 he was an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at PureTech Ventrures in Boston, MA where he focused on emerging technologies in the field of drug delivery. He is currently a member of seven Editorial Advisory Boards including Pharmaceutical Research, Journal of Controlled Release, Analytical Biochemistry and Experimental Biology and Medicine. His funding sources include NIH, NSF, the Coulter Foundation and the Department of Defense. He is a Fellow of AIMBE (reserved for the top 2% of Biomedical Engineers in the United States) and the Coulter Foundation. He received his B.S. in Pharmacy from Union University and his Ph.D. in Pharmaceutical Chemistry from the University of Utah.The Putnam research group focuses on the design and synthesis of functional biomaterials.Using organic polymer chemistry and micro/molecular biology, we build biomaterial from first principles and apply them to human health.Research areas include vaccine/adjuvant design and delivery, synthetic lubricants, surgical devices and drug delivery systems.Research InterestsDrug Delivery and NanomedicinePolymers and Soft MatterMechanics of Biological MaterialsBiomedical EngineeringBioengineeringTissue Engineering and BiomaterialsBiomolecular EngineeringTeaching InterestsEngineering principles for biomedical applications.Selected PublicationsZawaneh, P N., S P.
