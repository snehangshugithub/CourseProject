His recent efforts included developing chemical-reaction mechanism reduction tools and algorithms for graphics processing units (GPUs) in order to enable the use of detailed, accurate chemical models in combustion simulations. Other research interests include computational modeling of multi-physics flows for applications in aerospace, transportation, and energy systems. Biography Kyle E. Niemeyer is an Associate Professor at theOregon State Universityin theSchool of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering. He leads the Niemeyer Research Group, which uses computational modeling to study various phenomena involving fluid flows, including combustion and chemical kinetics, and related topics like numerical methods and parallel computing. He is also interested in open access, open source, and open science in general, and has contributed in the area of standardizing research software citation. Kyle received his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering fromCase Western Reserve Universityin 2013, working with Jackie Sung and theCombustion Diagnostics Laboratory(now at the University of Connecticut). He received BS and MS degrees in Aerospace Engineering fromCase Western Reserve Universityin 2009 and 2010, respectively. Selected Publications Tejas C. Mulky and Kyle E. Niemeyer. 2019.
