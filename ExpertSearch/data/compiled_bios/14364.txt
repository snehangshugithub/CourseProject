Within the realm of molecular and nanoscale science many new molecules, nanocrystals, electronic materials, and device architectures can be envisioned that may be able to address our current energy harvesting, utilization, and storage challenges. However, the scientific understanding of the chemistry and fundamental processes involved and the engineering necessary to develop economic and sustainable solutions is still in its infancy. Research efforts within the group span the range from fundamental studies of molecular precursor chemistry, nanocrystal nucleation and growth, and materials defect chemistry to device fabrication, characterization, and modeling of solar cells and fuel cells to system-level analyses of the life-cycle and impact of potential new technologies. This system-level approach is used to identify opportunities, avoid unforeseen consequences (like indirect market effects and environmental issues), and enlighten the molecular and nanoscale approaches we develop. Please see the Hillhouse Research Group Website to learn more. Opportunities for Undergraduate, Graduate, and Postdoctoral Researchers The Hillhouse Group typically has openings for undergraduate researchers, graduate students seeking a PhD or MS, and postdoctoral researchers. Please see the Group's website for more information and a list of openings. Teaching Hillhouse has developed and taught graduate courses on: (1) Advanced Solar Energy Conversion, (2) Electrochemistry, (3) X-ray and Neutron Scattering Methods, (4) Nanomaterials Chemistry and Engineering, and (5) Transport Phenomena. He has also developed an undergraduate course on the Principles of Molecular Engineering which is offered every year. He has been recognized for his teaching and received the Shreve Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching from Purdue University.
