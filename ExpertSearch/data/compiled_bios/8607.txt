He received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiaotong University, P.R.China, in 1998, and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2004. Between 2004 and 2012, he was a Research Staff Member at the IBM T.J. Watson research center. Between 2012 and 2016, he was a faculty member in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Utah. Gang organizes HealthInformaticsWorld, an open email list on health informatics for distributing related conference, journal, book, grant, software, and job information. Anybody with interest can subscribe to it by sending an email to HealthInformaticsWorld+subscribe@googlegroups.com. Research Interests Gang's research interests include health/clinical informatics (software system design/development and data analytics), machine learning, big data, information retrieval, database systems, and data mining with a focus on health applications. He invented the first method for automatically providing rule-based explanations for any machine learning model's prediction/classification results with no accuracy loss, the first method for efficiently automating machine learning model selection, the questionnaire-guided intelligent medical search engine iMed, intelligent personal health record, and SQL, machine learning, and compiler progress indicators.
