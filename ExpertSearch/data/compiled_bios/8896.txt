Honors and Awards NSF CAREER Award Google Faculty Research Award ARO Young Investigator Program Award (YIP) NSF CISE Research Initiation Initiative (CRII) Award Wing Kai Cheng Fellowship,University of Illinois Best Paper Award,16th IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS) Biography Dong Wang joined the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois as an associate professor in August 2021. He previously served asan associate professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Notre Dame. His honors includethe NSF CAREER Award, Google Faculty Research Award, Young Investigator Program (YIP) Award from the US Army Research Office, NSF CRII Award, Wing Kai Cheng Fellowship from the University of Illinois, and the Best Paper Award of IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS). Wangs work has been applied in a wide range of real-world applications such as misinformation detection, social network analysis, crowd-based disaster response, intelligent transportation, urban planning, and environment monitoring. He has published over 100 technical papers in peer reviewed conferences and journals. His research on social sensing, intelligence and computing resulted in software tools that found applications in academia, industry, and government research labs. He authored a monograph, "Social Sensing: Building Reliable Systems on Unreliable Data," which waspublished by Elsevier in 2015.Wang holds a PhDin computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.
