University of Wisconsin - Madison, 1991 B.S. University of Wisconsin - Madison, 1989 Research Interests Accelerating Statistical Machine LearningNovel computer architectures targeted at machine learning problems that rely on Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques and probabilistic computing in general. Multicore/multiprocessor and Distributed Systems (including data centers)Cache coherence protocols, memory consistency, runtime systems to expose and exploit parallelism. I also explore the use of new hardware technology in data centers. Architectures for Emerging TechnologiesComputational paradigms enabled by new technologies. Memory SystemsGeneral aspects of memory hierarchies such as cache design, prefetching, latency tolerance, etc. Energy Efficient ComputingProcessor and memory design, operating system support.
