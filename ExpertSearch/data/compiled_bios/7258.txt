Chemistry, Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski", BulgariaResearch InterestsMathematical modeling of physical and biological systems. Current projects explore membrane biophysics (biomembrane electromechanics and stability, thermal shape fluctuations) andnon-equilibrium soft matter (emergent phenomena and self-organization in active matter, directed assembly, nonlinear particle dynamics, rheology of complex fluids). Research in my group inegrates theory and experiment.
