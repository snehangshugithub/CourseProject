People Dr Shoaib Jameel People Dr Shoaib Jameel Lecturer School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CSEE) Email shoaib.jameel@essex.ac.uk Location 5A.529, Colchester Campus Academic support hours Tuesday: 12:00 PM until 1:00 PM (Zoom ID: 97561813599) Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Biography My work revolves around proposing novel computational methods for machine learning with applications to text mining. Specifically, my work has centred around learning low-dimensional representations of natural language text on a large-scale. Among others, I have developed a variety of probabilistic topic models, which have seen applications in text mining and information retrieval, as well as vector space embeddings, which have shown promising results in tasks such as knowledge base completion and commonsense reasoning.
