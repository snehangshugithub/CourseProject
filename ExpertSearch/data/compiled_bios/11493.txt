He served at the Greek National Energy council (1976-79) the MIT Energy Laboratory (1979-82) and was chair of the Greek Regulatory Authority for Energy from February 2005 till recently. He has directed several research projects sponsored by NSF, EPRI, NYSERDA and the Industry, authored many journal articles and co-authored Spot Pricing of Electricity, Kluwer, 1988. He researches complex stochastic production systems and decision support in real-time electric power markets. He currently focuses on the Cyber-Physical-Energy-System/Smart Grid that (i) is open to developers and users to render it capable of supporting real-time market at the wholesale and retail levels, and (ii) enables load and distributed resource management to mitigate T&D and Ancillary Services congestion and realize synergies among market-ready sustainable energy technologies including wind generation, distributed storage, roof-top PV and Hybrid Electric Vehicles.
