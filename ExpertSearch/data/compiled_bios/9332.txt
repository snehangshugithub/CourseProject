After studyingMathematics and Physics at the University of Vienna from 2006-2013, I obtainedmy PhD in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge in 2017. Iwas a Postdoctoral Research Associateat JILA, University of Colorado Boulder from 2016-2019, and a Joint Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Quantum Computing, University of Waterloo and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics from 2019-2020. In January 2021 I joined the Department of Mathematics at UIUC as an Assistant Professor. My research focuses on quantum information theory. Research InterestsMathematical and computational aspects of quantum information theory Research DescriptionI study mathematical and computational aspects of quantum information theory. In particular, I am interested in the following topics: Quantum channels and their various capacities Additivity problems Multipartite entanglement Stabilizer formalism, in particular graph states Teleportation protocols Entropic quantities and their properties (see my PhD thesis) Second order asymptotics Classical and quantum network information theory To study these topics, I use tools from representation theory and group theory, matrix analysis, convex optimization (in particular semidefinite programming), global optimization, and machine learning.
