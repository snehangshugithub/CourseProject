Other topics include: mesoscopic and nanoscale charge and spin inhomogeneity in transition metal oxides, novel NMR techniques, such as spin echo double resonance and multiple quantum coherence, and their application to condensed matter systems, and the behavior of matter under extreme conditions (milliKelvin temperatures, GPa hydrostatic pressures, high magnetic fields).
