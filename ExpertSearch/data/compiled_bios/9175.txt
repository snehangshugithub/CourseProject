Rogers obtained BA and BS degrees in chemistry and in physics from the University of Texas, Austin, in 1989. From MIT, he received SM degrees in physics and in chemistry in 1992 and the PhD degree in physical chemistry in 1995. From 1995 to 1997, Rogers was a Junior Fellow in the Harvard University Society of Fellows. During this time he also served as a founder and Director of Active Impulse Systems, a company that commercialized technologies developed during his PhD work. He joined Bell Laboratories as a Member of Technical Staff in the Condensed Matter Physics Research Department in 1997, and served as Director of this department from the end of 2000 to 2002.

Research Statement We seek to exploit unusual materials -- polymers, nanowires, nanotubes, etc. -- for new types of electronic and photonic systems. We also develop 'soft lithographic' and biomimetic approaches for patterning them and guiding their growth. This work combines fundamental studies with forward-looking engineering efforts in a way that promotes positive feedback between the two. Our current research focuses on soft materials for flexible "macroelectronic" circuits, nanophotonic structures, microfluidic devices, and microelectromechanical systems. These efforts are highly multidisciplinary, and combine expertise from nearly every traditional field of technical study. Research Interests materials and patterning techniques for unusual format electronics, optoelectronics and photovoltaics; fiber and integrated optics and plasmonics; liquid crystals; ultrafast laser acoustics; 'soft' microelectromechanical systems; microfluidics; methods for nanofabrication Selected Articles in Journals J.
