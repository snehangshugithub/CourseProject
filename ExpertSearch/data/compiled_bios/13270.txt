University of Pune, 2007 B.S. MES Abasaheb Garware College, 2005 I am interested in cohomology of algebras, deformation theory and Hopf algebras. In particular, I study finite generation of cohomology of algebras. The property of being finitely generated is very important because it is much easier to understand a finitely generated algebra. A finitely generated commutative algebra is useful for geometric study via algebraic geometry. I am interested in studying deformation theory of algebras & modules, and Hopf algebras. Recently, I started to work in the area of graphs and hypergraphs.
