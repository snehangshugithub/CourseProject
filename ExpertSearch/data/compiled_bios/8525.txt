Consumer Health Informatics as I understand it conceives, evaluates, and introduces end-to-end safe services for patient to take an active role in their preventive and medical care. Patient Generated Health Data science tries to create value from data that patients gather themselves in conjunction with clinical, environmental and other health related data. Global Health tries to improve health care in resource poor settings, including using low cost mobile technology for Consumer Health initiatives.
