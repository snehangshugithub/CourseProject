Mechanical Engineering, SUNY at Stony Brook, 1984Ph.D. Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Princeton University, 1989 Professor Chelliah joined theUniversity of Virginiain the Fall of 1992. He received his B.Sc. degree (First-Class Honors) in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Moratuwa in Sri Lanka in January 1981, MS degree in Mechanical Engineering from SUNY at Stony Brook in August 1984, and Ph.D. degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Princeton University in January 1989. After completion of his Ph.D., he continued his research work at Princeton University as a Research Associate/Staff Member from 1988-1992. Professor Chelliah is an active member of the Combustion Institute, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). He is a Fellow of ASME, an Associate Fellow of AIAA anda member of the AIAA Technical Committee on Propellants and Combustion. He is also a member of the Editorial Board of the journalCombustion Theory and Modelling.
