Harvard University, Cambridge, MA M.S., Chemical Physics, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA M.Phil., Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK B.S., Chemistry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NCResearch InterestsOur research has led to fundamental contributions to our understanding of the molecular principles that enable biological systems to sense and adapt to changing environments, and to understanding how we can use these principles to engineer synthetic biological systems that benefit humankind. A focal point of our work is RNA a fundamental component of all living systems that enacts genetic, regulatory and catalytic functions by folding into intricate shapes within cells. Through development of high throughput RNA structure/function measurement technologies, we have discovered new ways in which the complexity of RNA folding can be distilled into simple rules, and have shown that these rules can be used to design new synthetic RNAs to control genetic processes. This discovery-to-design research paradigm is now making possible a whole new toolkit based on synthetic biotechnology principles that has the potential to transform our world through tackling global challenges, most recently through our development of low-cost, on-demand diagnostic technologies that can detect water contaminants and pathogens.Selected PublicationsJ.
