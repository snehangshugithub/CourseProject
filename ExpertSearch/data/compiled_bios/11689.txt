Google Scholar Featured Grants & Projects Magnetic Resonance Imaging Techniques Our research focuses on the development and optimization of magnetic resonance imaging techniques, particularly those for rapid and three-dimensional imaging, drawing on a variety of physics and engineering principles, with a strong emphasis on theoretical modeling and simulation and on practical implementation and evaluation. Currently, our major focuses include high-resolution 3-D imaging of the brain using conventional proton-based methods and imaging and spectroscopy of the lung using hyperpolarized helium- and xenon-based methods. The comprehensive, high-resolution coverage accomplished with the techniques under development for 3-D brain imaging will provide more complete descriptions of pathological components of brain diseases, higher probabilities of detecting focal abnormalities, and more accurate quantitative evaluations of the extent of lesions. Hyperpolarized helium and xenon represent new MR-based contrast agents that are particularly well suited for imaging air spaces such as those in the lungs. This methodology provides high-resolution detailed images of the lungs that are far superior in quality to any existing clinical imaging methods. Contact Information John P.
