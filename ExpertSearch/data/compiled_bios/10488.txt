Semiconductor quantum dots are used to isolate single electron spins, which exhibit long quantum coherence times. These systems allow quantum mechanics to be harnessed in a solid state environment for the implementation of quantum gates. We use nanofabrication to create artificially structured systems with experimentally tunable Hamiltonians that can be controlled on sub-nanosecond timescales. Recent research examines strong light-matter interactions in the circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture, with a goal of generating long-range many body entanglement. Silicon and diamond are ideal host materials for spin coherence, leading to spin coherence times that now approach 10 seconds. A major effort in the group consists of developing a scalable quantum computing architecture in isotopically purified silicon. Research advances are enabled by a tight feedback loop that links nanoscale materials synthesis and advanced transport measurements. Research Opportunities in the Petta Lab: Research opportunities exist for highly motivated graduate students.Experiments will be performed at Princeton in the B-level of Jadwin Hall. Sample fabrication will take place at the PRISM cleanroom facilities. Our group combines low temperature expertise with nanofabrication, microwave and optical techniques to explore problems at the forefront of experimental condensed matter physics.
