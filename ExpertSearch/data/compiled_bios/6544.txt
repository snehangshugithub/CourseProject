Mechanical Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, 2014 M.E. Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, 2006 M.S. Computational Engineering, Purdue University, 2011 B.S. Mechanical Engineering, Utah State University, 2004 Research Statement The goal of The illimited LAB is to uncover the physical laws and mathematical principles that govern the innate dynamic functions of living structures. Drawing inspiration from the actuation mechanisms and material architectures seen in musculoskeletal systems, we are seeking to mimic biological functions to provide insights into their complex yet elegant and efficient dynamics. These insights help us establish new scientific and engineering foundations for creating living structures that go beyond the typical design objectives such as strength, stiffness and low mass, towards a new class of sentient structures capable of dynamic functions, such as actuation, sensing, thinking, self-healing, and adaptation.
