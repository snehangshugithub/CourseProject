Prior to that, he studied at the University of Alberta and Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland and worked as a structural engineering consultant with Cohos Evamy (now Dialog) in Edmonton. Scotts research focuses primarily on improving the safety and durability of metal structures in civil engineering applications. His research projects have investigated topics including: fatigue assessment and retrofitting of welded metal structures, encouraging the use of lighter, more corrosion resistant materials in new construction, and the development of new connection concepts to enable modular construction and reduce the costs associated with deconstruction and adaptive reuse. His research employs a broad range of tools, including laboratory testing, fracture mechanics, structural reliability theory, and life-cycle cost analysis. Currently, Scott is active on a number of CSA design code committees. In particular, he is chairing the aluminum structures technical subcommittee of the Canadian bridge design code (S6), as well as serving actively on the S6 technical subcommittee for steel structures, and the technical committees for the structural steel and aluminum welding codes (W59 and W59.2) and the aluminum structures design code (S157). In recent years he has served on the editorial boards for the IABSE journal: Structural Engineering International and the ASCE Journal of Bridge Engineering. Scott is also currently serving as Director for Waterloos new Architectural Engineering undergraduate program.Research InterestsFatigue assessmentFatigue retrofittingWelded metal structuresAluminum StructuresSteel StructuresModular constructionDesign for deconstructionStructural testingFracture mechanicsStructural reliability analysisLife-cycle cost analysisEducation2005, Doctorate, Civil Engineering, Steel Structures Laboratory (ICOM) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL)1998, Master's, Structural Engineering, University of Alberta1996, Bachelor's, Civil Engineering, University of AlbertaCourses*AE 199 - SeminarTaught in 2021AE 265 - Structure & Props of MaterialsTaught in 2020AE 298 - SeminarTaught in 2021AE 299 - SeminarTaught in 2020AE 398 - SeminarTaught in 2021CIVE 265 - Structure & Props of MaterialsTaught in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020CIVE 401 - Civil Eng Design Project 2Taught in 2016CIVE 498 - SeminarTaught in 2016CIVE 512 - Rehabilitation of StructuresTaught in 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021ENVE 298 - SeminarTaught in 2020GENE 119 - Problems SeminarTaught in 2019, 2020* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsShah, LH and Fleury, A and St-George, L and Walbridge, S and Gerlich, AP, Evolution of process parameters in friction stir welding of AA6061 aluminum alloy by varying tool eccentricity, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 109(5), 2020, 1601 - 1612Ranjan, Rakesh and Walbridge, Scott and Shah, Luqman and Gerlich, Adrian, Probabilistic Fracture Mechanics Analysis of Friction Stir Weld Fatigue Performance, , 58, 2020Sjaarda, Matthew and West, Jeffrey S and Walbridge, Scott, Reliability Analysis of Welded Stud Shear Connectors on Simply-Supported Bridge Girders, Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 2020Shah, LH and Huda, N and Esmaeili, S and Walbridge, S and Gerlich, AP, Structural morphology of Al-Mg-Si alloy friction stir welds through tool eccentricity, Materials Letters, 2020Enshassi, Mohammed SA and Walbridge, Scott and West, Jeffrey S and Haas, Carl T, Probabilistic Risk Management Framework for Tolerance-Related Issues in Modularized Projects: Local and Global Perspectives, ASCE-ASME Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in Engineering Systems, Part A: Civil Engineering, 6(1), 2020Fernando, D and Walbridge, S and Wan, B, A Markovian-based methodology for the life-cycle cost analysis of bridge maintenance interventions under changing deterioration rates, Journal of Civil Engineering Inter Disciplinaries, 1(1), 2020, 1 - 12Enshassi, Mohammed SA and Walbridge, Scott and West, Jeffrey S and Haas, Carl T, Dynamic and Proactive Risk-Based Methodology for Managing Excessive Geometric Variability Issues in Modular Construction Projects Using Bayesian Theory, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 146(2), 2020Graduate StudiesCurrently considering applications from graduate students.
