Consulted many companies and served in national committees.Visiting professor at MIT and ENSMA (France).Non-reactive flows: noise and flutter of the aircraft fan engine at the General Electric Research Center, followedby energy separation in flows, jets, and vortex dynamics.Parlayed concepts from non-reactive flows into reactive flows to resolve detonation problems.Led a team of students and colleagues to design and successefully operate a rotating detonation engine.
