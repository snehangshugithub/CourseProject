SciencesEducationPh.D,2013,Physics,Northeastern University M.S.,2009,Physics,Northeastern University B.S.,2007,Physics,Fudan UniversityBiographyPrior to joining Northwestern, Professor Wang was Assistant Professor of Information Sciences and Technology at the Pennsylvania State University and a Research Staff Member at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. Dashun received his PhD in Physics in 2013 from Northeastern University, where he was a member of the Center for Complex Network Research. From 2009 to 2013, he had also held an affiliation with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard University as a Research Associate. Dashun received his B.S. degree in Physics from Fudan University in 2007. He is a recipient of the AFOSR Young Investigator Award (2016).Research InterestsDashun Wang leads a group of highly interdisciplinary researchers who are extremely passionate about data. His research takes a multidisciplinary approach, combining computational social science, statistical physics, and computer science, to exploit the opportunities and promises offered by Big Data. Through the lens of new and increasingly available large-scale datasets, he hopes to use and develop tools of network science to help improve the way in which we understand the interconnectedness of the social technical and business world around us. His work has been applied to understand and predict social interactions, human mobility, knowledge production and scientific impact. His research has been published in general audience journals such as Nature, Science, and PNAS as well as top specialized venues in computer science and physics, and has been featured in Nature, Science, The Economist, MIT Technology Review, The Boston Globe, ORF, Physics World, among other major global media outlets.Significant RecognitionErdsRnyi Prize from The Network Science Society (2021)Thinkers50 Radar Class of 2021 (2021)Junior Scientific Award from the Complex Systems Society (2020)Poets & Quants Best 40 Under 40 Professors (2019)AFOSR Young Investigator award (2016)Selected PublicationsPotentially long-lasting effects of the pandemic on scientists.
