Introduction to Quantum Devices, TuTh 12:30PM - 1:59PM, Cory 293 Biography Alp Sipahigil is the Chang Hui Faculty Fellow and an Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. He has joint appointments as a Faculty Scientist at the Materials Sciences Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a supporting appointment at UC Berkeley Physics. His research is in solid-state quantum technologies, with a focus on hybrid quantum devices based onsuperconducting qubits, nanomechanics, nanophotonics, and atom-like defects in solids. Prior to joining Berkeley in 2021, he was an Institute for Quantum Information and Matter postdoctoral scholar at Caltech. He received his Ph.D. in Physics from Harvard University in 2017 and his B.S. degrees in Physics and Electrical Engineering from Bogazici University in 2010.
