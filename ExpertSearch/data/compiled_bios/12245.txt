Wobbrock is a Professor of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in The Information School and, by courtesy, in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. Prof. Wobbrock directs the ACE Lab, is founding co-director of the CREATE Center, and is a founding member of the DUB Group and the MHCI+D degree.Prof. Wobbrock is a proud husky! The University of Washington is a standout research university in all respects. In 2019 and 2020, U.S. News ranked UW #10 in the world, while Thomson Reuters ranked UW the #1 most innovative public university worldwide. The Information School is ranked #2 and computer science is ranked #6 in the U.S. In HCI, UW's multi-departmental DUB Group is an elite HCI consortium, considered one of the best in the world.Prof. Wobbrock's research seeks to scientifically understand people's experiences of computers and information, and to improve those experiences by inventing new interactive technologies, especially for people with disabilities. His specific research topics include input & interaction techniques, human performance measurement & modeling, HCI research & design methods, mobile computing, and accessible computing.He has co-authored ~180 peer-reviewed papers and received 25 paper awards, including 7 best papers and 8 honorable mentions from ACM CHI, the flagship conference in HCI. For his contributions to accessible computing, he received the 2017 SIGCHI Social Impact Award and the 2019 SIGACCESS ASSETS Paper Impact Award. In 2018 and 2020, he was ranked #1 and #2, respectively, on AMiner's Most 100 Influential Scholars in HCI, which algorithmically ranks authors based on citation networks. At CHI 2019 in Glasgow, Scotland, he was inducted into the prestigious CHI Academy for his overall contributions to HCI. He is also a Senior Member of the Association for Computing Machinery.Prof. Wobbrock's work and ideas have been reported in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Seattle Times, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, The Huffington Post, The Guardian, Der Spiegel, M.I.T. Technology Review, PC World, Self Magazine, USA Today, and other outlets.He is the recipient of an NSF CAREER award and 7 other National Science Foundation grants. He is on the editorial board of ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction. His former doctoral students are now professors at Harvard, Cornell, Colorado, Washington, Brown, Simon Fraser, and elsewhere.Prof. Wobbrock is also an entrepreneur. From 2012-2015, he was the venture-backed co-founder and C.E.O. of AnswerDash, during which time he raised over $2.5M in venture capital, launched a multi-platform SaaS product, signed 35 corporate customers, and built a team of 15 employees. In 2020, AnswerDash was acquired by CloudEngage.Jacob O. Wobbrock received a B.S. with Honors in Symbolic Systems (1998) and an M.S. in Computer Science (2000) from Stanford University. He received a Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction (2006) from the Human-Computer Interaction Institute in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. Upon graduating, he was honored with CMU's School of Computer Science Distinguished Dissertation Award.
