His expertise covers various experimental techniques including steady and unsteady surface pressure measurements, hotwire anemometry, laser Doppler velocimetry, Particle Image Velocimetry, force balance, and various flow visualization techniques. His work has focused on the integration of multiple measurement techniques in experimental setups to maximize data output and quality. His current efforts include the development of high quality/low uncertainty measurement system for uncertainty quantification and validation of CFD models. His expertise in aerodynamic testing has led him to be a core member of the Center for Renewable Energy and Aerodynamic Testing (CREATe). Aero-Acoustic Testing of Wind Turbine Blade Sections Dr. Borgoltz has been the assistant director of the Stability Wind Tunnel since 2010. Under his leadership, the facility has seen a vast improvement of its instrumentation and capabilities primarily thanks to an increase in commercial research testing. The unique capabilities of the Stability Wind Tunnel (with both a traditional hard wall test-section and the novel Kevlar-walled anechoic test-section) have attracted and continue to attract the world leading wind turbine manufacturers to evaluate the aerodynamic performance and acoustic signature of their blade designs.
