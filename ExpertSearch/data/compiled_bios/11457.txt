Of particular interest are the plasma interactions in the near-Earth environment and the coupling of energy from the sun into the Earths magnetic system. As an experimentalist, Dr. Walsh is involved in a number of ongoing NASA spacecraft missions including THEMIS and MMS. Dr. Walsh is currently involved in the development of small spacecraft and soft x-ray technology to, for the first time, take images of the interaction of the sun and solar wind with the Earths plasma environment to provide a global picture.
