The primary goal is to provide confidence profiles (given in terms of the probability of reaching a certain design target such as unit manufacturing cost of a system or any aspect of its life cycle performance including life cycle cost) on any performance and cost target at the earliest stages (concept exploration and preliminary design) of product development.Project Design and Complex SystemsAircraft, Ocean and Space systems development is understood well as the integration and management of a system of systems. This systems nature has not changed recently, yet the complexity of subsystems has continued to increase. More significantly, recent decades have shown a dramatic transformation of development organizations through the way project teams are engaged to deliver the subsystems. These changes to both the systems and how teams are organized to participate have led to difficulties, resulting in a decline in judgment, inaccurate forecasts, and subsequent poor delivery. Existing systems engineering and project management techniques must be extended for this new work ecosystem. Ongoing research and industrial experiences with the Project Design approach to project/program planning have led to methods to overcome this common challenge in complex systems development. Coordination as real activity by teams to satisfy dependencies is predicted and prioritized by examining the interplay of product, process, and organization architectures. Project architecture is designed in this light, with accurate forecasts of cost, schedule, and risk. In turn, an information architecture is established to enable the highest valuable coordination over the lifecycle of the product systemOptimal Life Cycle Information Architecture by Leveraging Project ArchitecturesThe concept of Life Cycle Information Architecture (LCIA) has been under continual development for several decades and has been alternatively known as persistent information database, product process organization (PPO from the DARPA DICE program), and life cycle project audit, among others. LCIA provides a vehicle and reveals the pattern for interaction among distributed project teams, subcontractors, and suppliers. The Project Design approach to complex system development arrives at an optimal LCIA through iteration of the organizational, product and project architectures. The time scale over which the LCIA is established is short in comparison to the systems total life cycle. In addition, the operational cost over the life of a large system such as the space shuttle is typically many times more than the total development and acquisition costs. Access to the right information, at the right time and to the right people is invaluable for those instances when critical operational decisions must be made. The Apollo 13 incident is a good example where critical information was required in real time.MHD wave propagation in random inhomogeneous plasmasA plasma medium, particularly fusion plasmas, is the prototypical stochastic medium. Wave propagation through such a medium results in a host of physical effects, most prominently wave scattering along with mode conversion and energy dissipation. The bulk of our research has concentrated on the propagation of plasma waves through the edge region of toroidal fusion plasma experiments such as tokomak devices. Desired is sufficient penetration of the wave energy into the center of fusion plasmas where energy absorption and plasma heating should occur. Depending on the fluctuation statistics significant scattering may occur thus reducing the desired plasma heating.
