My research interests are in sensory neurobiology and ecology, which pertains to understanding the influence of chemical signals on ecological interactions, and the neural basis of behavior. From the spatial scale of a sperm cell, to that of a macroorganism, the ability to locate the source of a chemical cue mediates many fundamental biological processes. 2004-10 University of Arizona Neuroscience 2004 UC Los Angeles Biology 1997 UC Santa Cruz Biology Sharlene Santana and Jeffrey Riffell in UW News on new research about role of scent compounds in the coevolution of bats and pepper plants Jeff Riffell & David Perkel awarded research grants from Human Frontier Science Program Jeff Riffell in UW News: Mosquitoes are drawn to flowers as much as people and now scientists know why No publications found Main menu PeopleFacultyGraduate StudentsPostdocsStaffResearchGrad SpotlightFields of InterestUndergraduate OpportunitiesPrograms & CoursesUndergraduateAdmissionsAcademic ResourcesAdvisingAwards & ScholarshipsHonorsIntroductory CoursesInternshipsPeer facilitatorsRegistrationResearch OpportunitiesGraduateAwards & FellowshipsPh.D ProgramAdmissionsFAQGuidelinesLab RotationsFundingStudent LifeGrad TravelPostdoctoral FellowsPostdoc FAQRelated ProgramsUWINNeurobiologyCollege of the EnvironmentMicrobiologyCoursesFacilitiesLife Sciences ComplexGreenhouseResearchTeachingSupportContactResearchBackup FreezersImagingContactEquipmentInformationLocationPolicyRatesScheduleLearningBiology Study AreaTri-Beta AssistancePartnersBurke MuseumFriday Harbor LabsHerbariumNews & EventsCOVID-19 informationRecent NewsEventsSeminarsAutumnWinterSpringNewslettersBlogsMedicinal Herb GardenNature's DepthsSciPosAbout usSupport UW BiologyDiversity in BiologyDept Culture Office HourDiversity and Equity CommitteeResourcesJoin UW BiologyContact usDepartmental committeesMentoring resourcesVirtual tourLogin UW Home Directories Libraries Maps My UW 2016 University of Washington Department of Biology / Seattle, Washington /Privacy/ Terms of Use
