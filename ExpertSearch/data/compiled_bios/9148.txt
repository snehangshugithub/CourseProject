Dr. Rockett is a Professor of Materials Science at the University of Illinois. His research interests include sputter deposition and characterization of CuInSe 2 for photovoltaics; growth of thin films; microchemical and microstructural analysis of thin films including by TEM, XPS, SIMS, and other methods; modeling of materials, especially semiconductors, using Monte Carlo, density functional theory, and continuum methods; and microelectromechanical systems. Dr. Rockett has more than 115 publications on these topics as well as on dopant segregation during crystal growth, ion source design, and transition metal oxide and nitride deposition and characterization. He has presented more than 40 invited talks. Dr. Rockett is a Fellow of the American Vacuum Society. He was an Assistant Dean of Academic Programs in the College of Engineering in 1993-94 and in 2000 was a member of the technical staff at the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Basic Energy Sciences. He currently serves on advisory panels for the University Grants Committee of the Government of Hong Kong. Dr. Rockett has participated in the planning of numerous international conferences for the AVS, IUVSTA, TMS and MRS, and serves on several committees of the AVS including the International Interactions Committee. He is a short course instructor for the AVS and has given tutorial lectures for the IEEE, at the Argonne National Laboratory, MRS and at national meetings of the Chinese, Swedish and Mexican Vacuum Societies. He is a member of the Editorial Board of the Journal Materials Chemistry and Physics, the Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology, and has served as a guest editor of several conference proceedings including the Thin Films portion of IVC-12/ICSS-8 and E-MRS 2002, and ICTF-13.
