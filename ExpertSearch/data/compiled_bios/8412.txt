While we have carried out some projects involving bacteria, our primary focus is on filamentous fungi. We use a sophisticated set of analytical tools (electron microscopy, digital image analysis, atomic force microscopy) to asses fungal morphology and the physical properties of fungal cell walls. As an important tool in our molecular studies, we use a functional-genomic technique called proteomic analysis. This process involves the identification and quantification of individual proteins from various cellular fractions (e.g., cytoplasm, vacuoles, cell wall). These data are used for differential comparison allowing us to make deductions about cellular mechanisms. We are also developing new ways to use proteomic analysis to study cellular signaling pathways (phospho-proteomics). Recently, we have used all of these tools to better understand a fundamental cellular recycling-pathway called autophagy. And currently, we are studying the relationship between fungal morphology and protein secretion.
