Personal profile Research interestsProfessor Soleimani leads the Engieering Tomography Lab (ETL) group he found in 2011. ETL works in partnership with leading UK and internatioanl research teams and many industrial partners. Particular interests are in ultrasound tomography, electrical and electromagnetic imaging and X-ray CT, nonlinear inverse problems, machine learning, and multi-modality imaging. The main areas are in, "Machine Learning", Super-Sensing, "X-ray CT", "Ultrasound tomography", Multi-modality Tomography, Inverse Problems, and Electrical and Electromagnetic Tomography, "Bio-impedance imaging", including: 1) Medical imaging , 2) Industrial process tomography, 3) Tomography for material characterisation. Professor Soleimani has led the University of Bath's collaborations with CERN through CMS research and educational partnership established from 2019. This followed a highly successful medical imaging project between Bath and CERN leading to a joint open source software platform TIGRE.Teaching interestsProf Soleimani proposed and created our very successful new UG degree in Robotics Engineering, started in 2018. He has been instrumental in success of Integrated Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (IMEE) an MEng course running since 2007.
