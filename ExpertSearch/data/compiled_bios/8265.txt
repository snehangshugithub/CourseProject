We actively tackle problems and explore new research directions by using microscopy, microfluidics, high-speed imaging and image analysis, materials processing and characterization. We also complement our experiments with theoretical modeling and numerical simulations, using ideas from fluid dynamics, polymer physics, colloidal science and biophysics. Our work is thus highly multi-disciplinary, combining expertise from engineering, physics, chemistry, materials science and biology. Our ultimate goal is to bridge fundamental research with meaningful and positive societal impacts.Currently, we focus on three key areas in our work: (1)Bubble dynamics with a compound interface (2)Vesicle responses in non-equilibrium environment (3)Polymer self-assembly for delivery and diagnostic Research Areas Applied Physics Chemistry Energy Environment Fluid Mechanics Health and Bio Manufacturing Selected Articles in Journals Ji, B, Yang, Z, and Feng, J,Oil-coated bubble formation from submerged co-axial orifices, Physical Review Fluids, accepted.
