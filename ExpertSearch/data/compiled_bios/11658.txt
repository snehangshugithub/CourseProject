He also holds a Master of Business, Entrepreneurship and Technology (MBET) from the Conrad School of Entrepreneurship and Business at the University of Waterloo. Dr. Bachmann is primarily interested in studying the spatial economic and transport interaction (SETI) process, trade and transportation, and transport economics and finance. He is also interested in emerging technologies such as new mobility paradigms and next generation travel demand modelling. His research group has worked with various agencies including Transport Canada, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), the Region of Waterloo, Canada West Foundation (CWF), Innovation Science and Economic Development (ISED) Canada, and the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). In 2017, he received the Transportation Research Boards (TRBs) Fred Burggraf Award for excellence in transportation research by researchers 35 years of age or younger. Dr. Bachmann regularly teaches "Economics and Life Cycle Cost Analysis" (CIVE 392) and "Transportation Engineering Applications" (CIVE 341) to undergraduate engineering students at the University of Waterloo. He also teaches "Modelling Transportation and Spatial Economics" (CIVE 645) to graduate engineering students. In 2019, he received the University of Waterloos Faculty of Engineering Teaching Excellence Award for an ongoing record of excellence in undergraduate teaching.Research InterestsSpatial Economic and Transport InteractionTrade and Freight TransportationTransport Economics and FinanceNew Mobility ParadigmsNext Generation Travel Demand ModellingEducation2020, Master of Business, Entrepreneurship and Technology, Conrad School, University of Waterloo2015, Doctorate, Civil Engineering, University of Toronto2011, Master of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, University of Toronto2009, Bachelor of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, University of TorontoCourses*CIVE 341 - Transportatn Eng.
