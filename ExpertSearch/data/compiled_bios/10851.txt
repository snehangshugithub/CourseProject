She is an interdisciplinary scholar, a disability advocate, and a scholar-artist. Her dissertation, Sleeping Everywhere: Narrating How People with Narcolepsy Navigate Everyday Life, uses experimental performative writing to describe how people with narcolepsy experience specific spaces (i.e. home, work, driving, and leisure). She is the winner of numerous awards and her work has been supported by Ohio Humanities, a state affiliate of the National Endowment for the Humanities. Her research focuses on the particular ways hidden disabilitiesespecially neurological disabilitiesare shaped by cultural dynamics. She uses cultural studies, qualitative, ethnographic, and autoethnographic methods to examine the experience of navigating a visual culture with a hidden disability. Dr. Eugene has published research on a range of conditions that includes but is not limited to: Bipolar, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Parkinsons Disease, and Narcolepsy. Her main research interests are: hidden disabilities, sleep, race, cultural studies, performance studies, critical theory, health narratives, feminism, and science and technology studies. Her first forays into research was when she began to look into the meaning of her last name Eugene while still in high school. She quickly discovered the American Eugenics movement and a lifelong love of researching the various ways culture shapes how people understand human diversity. When not working, Dr. Eugene enjoys running, writing poetry, and nurturing an addiction to fiction and non-fiction audiobooks. Selected Bibliography Eugene, N. and J. Nelson (2017).
