Cabot Career Development Professor; Member, Whitehead Institute Ankur Jain investigates the role of RNA self-assembly in cellular organization and neurodegenerative disease. 617-452-3563 Phone WI-561C Office ajain@wi.mit.edu Email Lab Website Beverly Dobson Assistant 617-258-5214 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 2013, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign BTech, 2007, Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur Research Summary We study how biomolecules in a cell self-organize. In particular, we are interested in understanding how membrane-free cellular compartments such as RNA granules form and function. Our lab develops new biochemical and biophysical techniques to investigate these compartments and to understand their dysfunction in human disease.
