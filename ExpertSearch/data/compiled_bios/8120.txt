In particular, Dr. Corbin investigates the interactions between physical forces, rheological properties, and biochemical cues regulate virtually all aspects of cell physiology. Specifically, her work involves engineering dynamic microenvironments for control of mechanical stiffness and applied forces across the cardiac cycle.
