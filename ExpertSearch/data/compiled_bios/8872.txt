Honors and Awards Teacher Ranked as Excellent, University of Illinois (Spring 2021) NSF CRII award Google Faculty Research Award Best Paper Honorable Mention at the ACM CHI Conference NSF I-Corps Award iConference Best Paper Award Biography Yun Huang is an assistant professor in the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She co-directs the Social Computing Systems (SALT) Lab. Before joining Illinois, she was a faculty member in the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University and a postdoc fellow at Carnegie Mellon University. Her work focuses on social computing systems research, in which she examines context-driven approaches of designing crowdsourcing systems. For example, her research examines how different contexts impact user contributions to crowdsourcing systems; how to leverage these contextual effects to design innovative social computing systems that can better engage users; and how crowdsourced user behavioral data may help better understand users and the community. She received her PhDfrom the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine. She earned her bachelor's degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, in Beijing, China.
