I received the M.E. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH) in 2007 and the Ph.D. degree in brain-computer interaction (BCI) from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) in 2014, where I subsequently served as a post-doctoral researcher until May 2015. My thesis title is "Mutual learning and spelling in Motor Imagery BCI". In June 2015 I joined the Wyss Center for Bio- and Neuro-engineering at Campus Biotech, Geneva, Switzerland working on BCI-based stroke rehabilitation. Between November 2017 and February 2019 I have been employed by Mindmaze SA as Biosignal Research Engineer. As of February 2019 I am serving as a Lecturer of the Neural Engineering and BCI Laboratory at the University of Essex, School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, UK. My main areas of research interest include brain-computer interface (BCI), theoretical and applied machine learning, artificial intelligence, bio-signal and especially electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signal processing, mutual learning and co-adaptation in BCI, translational and rehabilitation applications of BCI.
