Hair cells of the auditory organs respond to sound stimuli for hearing perception; those in the vestibular organs respond to gravity and head movements for perception of balance.Hair cells are called such because they have actin-rich protrusions, stereocilia, at their apical end. Displacement of stereocilia opens ion channels resulting in depolarization and release of transmitter from synapses at the basal end of the cell to terminals of innervating afferent nerves.Damage and loss of hair cells are leading causes of hearing and balance disorders, affecting over 40 million people in the US. Hair cells are susceptible to environmental insults, including noise, chemical exposure and accumulated damage during aging. Hair cell loss in humans is irreversible.Zebrafish lateral line hair cells share many properties with those of the inner ear, and are sensitive to the same types of damaging agents as human cells. However they are able to regenerate hair cells throughout life. The location of the lateral line on the surface of the body allows access for visualization and manipulation.We take an interdisciplinary approach to study hair cell development, death and regeneration that uses genetics, genome editing, single cell profiling, high resolution imaging, small molecule screening and computational modeling. The Raible lab values equity and inclusion and strives to provide a welcoming environment for trainees from diverse backgrounds. We recognize that oppressive policies create barriers that prevent the entry and participation of underrepresented groups, hindering the advancement of science. We provide resources to empower trainees and support their progression throughout their scientific careers.
