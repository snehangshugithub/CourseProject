Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA B.S. Chemical Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MIResearch InterestsElectrochemistry, catalysis, renewable energy, spectroscopy Our society faces an imminent need to address environmental, health, and political issues associated with energy and resource consumption, which are being further strained by a growing population. Catalysis can help pave the way to a more sustainable future by effectively facilitating key bond-making and bond-breaking reactions for production of renewable fuels and treatment of pollutants. Electrochemical reactions such as water splitting and CO2/CO reduction have attracted attention in the past few decades as promising energy conversion processes. These reactions are capable of producing a variety of compounds which are the foundation of our energy infrastructure and chemical industry with a massive global demand and annual production rates on the order of 10 billion tons per year. If the feed streams for these processes are composed of captured CO2, then a closed carbon cycle can be formed to result in net-neutral CO2 emissions and sustainable fuel production. Furthermore, access to clean drinking water and other natural resources is a critical global challenge facing society, both in developed and undeveloped countries. Development of more efficient and economic catalytic processes for removal or conversion of toxic chemicals is vital to help reduce industrial waste streams and increase accessibility to these resources. Research in the Seitz lab focuses on fundamental understanding of catalytic reactions and materials using insights from electrochemistry and spectroscopy towards the development of catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability. Our research lies at the interface of chemical engineering, materials science, and physics with the goal of improving the efficiency and technological viability of clean energy and chemical conversion processes. Electrochemical studies of controlled catalyst surfaces, with an emphasis on determining intrinsic catalyst activity, provide a basis from which to develop more in-depth knowledge of reaction mechanisms and limitations. In addition, we investigate physical, chemical, and electronic properties of catalysts at the surface and bulk using advanced material characterization techniques, including those available at the nearby synchrotron research facility (Advanced Photon Source) at Argonne National Lab. Emphasis of these studies are on the development and implementation of reactor cells for catalyst characterization under relevant operating conditions. The combination of these insights inform further catalyst tuning by adjusting various chemical and physical knobs, such as composition, morphology, and crystal structure, to develop the next generation of materials. It is the goal of this work to shift our global energy dependence away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy and ultimately reduce the negative impact of humans on our planet.Selected Publications L.C.
