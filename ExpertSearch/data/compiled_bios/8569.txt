And, he likes building systems that are used both within academics, to understand and evaluate newapproaches and methods, and outside of academics, to deliver real world value.He received his MD from the University of California, San Francisco, a Master of Health Sciences from the University of California,Berkeley, and a BSEE in Electrical Engineering from Tufts University. He completed a residency in Emergency Medicine at theUniversity of Arizona, and the Royal Brisbane Hospital, Queensland, Australia, after which he joined the faculty in the EmergencyMedicine at University of Washington. While at UW, he was awarded a F38 mid-career fellowship from the National Institutes ofHealth to support his career transition to basic sciences research, in Applied Medical Informatics. Currently he is a Professor inHealth Informatics and Global Health, jointly appointed in UWs Schools of Nursing, Medicine, and Public Health, and directs the UWClinical Informatics Research Group.Two major themes in both his research and teaching have been (1) development of patient-centered systems and patient-reported outcomes, and (2) the integration of clinical data to support population health applications. Bill has mentored masters, doctoral, and post-doctoral trainees from graduate programs in Public Health, Medicine, Bioengineering, Nursing Science, and Global Health. His students have worked on applied informatics across clinical, public health, and global health domains. He looks forward to working with a diverse group of students, across interesting health domains. Teaching: Currently accepting new MS, PhD, and Post-doc students.
