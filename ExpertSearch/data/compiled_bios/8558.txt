Affiliate Professor, Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education heckerma@hotmail.com Website Interests: Genomics, vaccine design, computational biology, machine learning Background: David is developing machine learning and statistical approaches for biological and medical applications including HIV vaccine design and genomics. In his early work, he demonstrated the importance of probability theory in Artificial Intelligence, and developed methods to learn graphical models from data, including methods for causal discovery. In his 25 years at Microsoft, he developed numerous applications including data-mining tools in SQL Server and Commerce Server, the junk-mail filters in Outlook, Exchange, and Hotmail, handwriting recognition in the Tablet PC, text mining software in Sharepoint Portal Server, troubleshooters in Windows, and the Answer Wizard in Office. He joined Human Longevity, Inc., in 2017, where he leads an advanced analytics team to tackle the analysis of large-scale medical and genomic data as their Chief Data Scientist.
