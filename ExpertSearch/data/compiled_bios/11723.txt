Biomedical Engineering, UC Davis, 2006 "My research focuses on inventing micro-scale, instructive biomaterials for accelerated and improved recovery from injury and illness with a heavy emphasis on clinical translation." Donald Richieri Griffin Donald Griffin improves clinical translation of acellular and cellular therapies throughenhanced hydrogel-tissue integration, specifically focusing on the development of passive and active instructional microenvironments using microscale building blocks. He is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia. After his training in Biomedical Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles, Don joined the faculty at the University of Virginia in 2017. His lab works on creating advanced biomaterials to support both fundamental science and translational approaches to tissue regeneration. Theyengineer biomaterials using a unique combination of microscale geometric control and novel chemistries. Don's work also bridges the academic-industry relationship with recognition as an inventor on several pending patents.Additionally, Don is aco-founder of a growing biomaterials company, Tempo Therapeutics (located in San Diego). Research Interests Novel Biomaterial Development Drug and Cell Delivery Regenerative Medicine In the News For Patient Airways Injured by Intubation, a New Approach for Healing For Patient Airways Injured by Intubation, a New Approach for Healing Deploying a Hydrogel to Wounds in the Trachea Poses a Distinct Challenge Biomaterials expert Don Griffin is taking his team's success using microporous annealed particle (MAP) gels for wound healing to a dynamic, difficult environment.
