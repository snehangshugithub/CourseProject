Izatt Michael J. Fitzpatrick Distinguished Professor of Engineering in the Edmund T. Pratt, Jr. School of Engineering My research centers on the development and application of cutting-edge optical technologies for non-invasive, high-resolution imaging and sensing in living biological tissues. Our laboratory is recognized for foundational contributions to optical coherence-based approaches for in vivo sub-surface microscopic tissue imaging, particularly optical coherence tomography (OCT) which has become a standard of care in ophthalmology and other clinical specialties.The technologies we employ include adaptive-optic devices, femtosecond lasers, ultrabroadband fiber optic telecommunications equipment, robots and robotic manipulators, high performance computing, and 3D display technologies. Together with our collaborators, we have developed and deployed multiple hand-held and intrasurgical systems for real-time volumetric imaging of the human eye, visualized using virtual/augmented reality displays and coupled to image-guided robotic microsurgical procedures. Our research team includes a rich and diverse group of highly motivated and productive undergraduate, MS and PhD students, staff and associated faculty along with multiple collaborations with engineers, biologists, and physicians at Duke and elsewhere.
