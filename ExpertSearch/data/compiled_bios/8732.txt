He received his B.Sc.(Physics) from Manchester University and D. Phil. (Physics) from Oxford University.The mission of his research group, the Environmental Dynamics Lab (ENDLab), is to advance understanding of environmental fluid dynamic phenomena to address societal grand challenges,with a committment to education and outreach to inform policy makers and the general public.His group conducts field studies, laboratoryexperiments and modeling of environmental flows with an emphasis on ocean dynamicsand transport. He received an NSF Career Award in Physical Oceanography and has been a PI on numerous oceanfield programs for NSF and ONR sponsored projects, with recent studies in the Arctic Ocean, the Timor Sea, the South Chinas Sea andthe Western Pacific. In recent years, he has established a research program at MIT studying scientific and societal aspects of deep-sea mining, with activities ranging from plume dynamic studies in the Pacific Ocean to the development of an international royalty payment regime for the International Seabed Authority.
