Biography Research Publications Related News Toggle Accordion Biography AboutProfessor Ratilal-Makris has extensive experimental and theoretical experience in remote sensing with acoustics and ultrasonics. The applications include long range acoustic detection, localization, and inference of underwater vehicles, geology, fish, and other objects in the ocean; linear and nonlinear ultrasound imaging for biomedical and military applications; and imaging in multipath environments.Professor Ratilal-Makris holds a PhD in acoustics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, 2002). She was was previously a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Ocean Engineering at MIT (2002-2004) and a Research Scientist at Singapores DSO National Laboratories (1994-1998). She was awarded the ONR Postdoctoral Award in Ocean Acoustics in 2002, the Bruce Lindsay Award by the Acoustical Society of America in 2006, the ONR Young Investigator (YIP) Award in 2007, and the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) in 2008.EducationPhD, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2002Honors & AwardsPresidential Early Career Award for Scientists and EngineersOffice of Naval Research Young Investigator AwardProfessional AffiliationsAcoustical Society of America, Fellow Toggle Accordion Research Research OverviewRemote sensing, underwater acoustics, acoustical oceanography, bioacoustics, ultrasound imaging, nonlinear scattering, wave propagation in random media, signal, image and array processing, statistical inference theory.College Research Initiatives Security, Sensing and Surveillance Systems link Department Research Areas Communications, Control & Signal Processing Electromagnetics, Plasma, & Optics Toggle Accordion Publications Selected PublicationsC.
