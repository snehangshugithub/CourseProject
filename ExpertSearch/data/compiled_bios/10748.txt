Materials Science & Engineering, Stony Brook University, NY B.E. Chemical & Molecular Engineering, Stony Brook University, NY About Kristine Research Interests I am interested in finding alternative sources of energy, especially those that are cleaner for the environment. Specific areas of interest include gas hydrates. A vast amount of energy-rich methane containing hydrates occur naturally in permafrost and marine environments when water and gas come in contact, but their extraction is costly and could result in seafloor instability. A solution is to exchange methane with carbon dioxide in methane hydrate reservoirs to form more stable carbon dioxide hydrates. I am interested in understanding the thermodynamics and kinetics of this exchange process. Also, I am working on projects investigating biofuel options, particularly those from cellulosic or algal sources. Specifically, I am working on finding energy efficient methods to pretreat and dewater algae for biofuel production and determining techniques to extract biogas and bioethanol from waste cellulosic materials.
