Rosen received the degrees of B.S. in Mathematics from the California Institute of Technology (2008), M.A. in Mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin (2010), and ScD in Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2016). Prior to joining Northeastern, he was a Research Scientist at Oculus Research (now Facebook Reality Labs) from 2016 to 2018, and a Postdoctoral Associate at MITs Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems from 2018 to 2021. His research addresses the mathematical foundations of robotic perception (including optimization, geometry and topology, probability and statistics, and machine learning) and their application to devise practical provably robust perception systems for safety-critical autonomy. His work has been recognized with a Best Paper Award at the International Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (2016), an RSS Pioneer Award at Robotics: Science and Systems (2019), and a Best Student Paper Award at Robotics: Science and Systems (2020).EducationSc.D.
