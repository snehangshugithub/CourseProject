B.A. in Zoology, Pomona College, Claremont, California, 1967. Ph.D. in Zoology, University of California, Los Angeles, 1972. I came to the University of Washington in 1976, joining the Department of Zoology, which became the Department of Biology in 2002. Before arriving in Seattle I was engaged in postdoctoral research in Germany, at the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology, and then in California, at UCLA and UC San Diego, investigating daily rhythms of behavior and seasonal reproductive patterns in desert rodents. During my years at University of Washington I have taken sabbatical travel opportunities to live and work in Australia and South America, as well as at the University of California-Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. My earlier research was centered in ecophysiology and behavior, and through all this time I have maintained an interest in the population biology of mammals. In 1995 my UW appointment was expanded, and I became Curator of Mammals at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, a unit of the College of Arts and Sciences. This has allowed me additionally to provide training opportunities for graduate students in the biogeography and evolution of mammalian populations, as I have expanded my research interests in those directions.
