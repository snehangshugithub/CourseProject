People who use stimulant drugs such as amphetamine and cocaine on a chronic basis can develop a psychosis that is similar to paranoid schizophrenia. This is of interest in light of our findings that chronic administration of amphetamine to rats can increase the utilization of dopamine, a brain neurotransmitter. To show this, we use microdialysis, a technique for analyzing neurotransmitter release in the brain. The alterations produced in transmitter utilization in the rat brain during chronic stimulant drug administration may be very similar to the changes occurring in the human brain exposed to stimulant drugs. These studies may provide insight into the biochemical changes occurring in the human brain that can contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders. Brown Affiliations Neuroscience Research Research Overview Our research is aimed at elucidating how alterations in neurotransmitter activity in the central nervous system influence behavior. We are especially interested in determining how chronic administration of a psychoactive drug, such as amphetamine, alters brain functioning from both a behavioral and transmitter point of view. Research Statement Our research is aimed at elucidating how alterations in neurotransmitter activity in the central nervous system influence behavior. We are especially interested in determining how chronic administration of a psychoactive drug, such as amphetamine, alters brain functioning from both a behavioral and transmitter point of view. In order to analyze the relationship between transmitter release and animal behavior, we use a microdialysis procedure that enables us to carry out concurrent measurements of transmitter release from the rat brain while monitoring animal behavior. In vivo release studies are complemented by in vitro studies of nerve ending (synaptosome) preparations isolated from discrete brain areas in order to study drug effects on transmitter synthesis, release, and uptake. Our hope is that these combined in vivo and in vitro studies will help elucidate the mechanisms via which chronic psychoactive drug administration alters the sensitivity of the brain to subsequent psychoactive drug exposure.
