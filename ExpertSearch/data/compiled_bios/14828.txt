Materials characterization is essential for materials science. The birth of a new characterization method, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), photoemission spectroscopy (PES), or inleastic neutron scattering (INS), all comes with great discoveries. However, the finite type of probe particles (e.g., photons, electrons, or neutrons) in one or more spaces (r, k, E, t) restricts the combination of measurable correlation functions, and even so, it is not always easy to interpret the experimental data. To tackle the challenge, we take an integrated quantum theory, machine-learning, unconventional use of spectroscopies, and new architecture design approach: Quantum theory lays the foundation on measurable correlation functions, machine-learning aids to uncover hidden properties buried in data, unconventional use of neutron, x-ray, and electron spectra empowers existing techniques to a broader scope, and an integration of all these into new architecture can enable the detection of materials properties that evade experimental detection.
