Brown is the Sidney Kaufman Professor in Geophysics. Brown earned a B.S. in physics from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Ph.D. in geological sciences from Cornell. Brown's primary research interest is the application of multichannel seismic reflection methods to the exploration of the continental lithosphere. Current research includes deep seismic investigations in China (especially Tibet), Mongolia, Taiwan, the Andes, and the Caribbean (Montserrat), the application of seismic interferometry to seismic body waves, imaging of crustal structure using microearthquakes and 4D seismic monitoring of deep tectonic processes. Brown's recent interests also include application of ground penetrating radar to archaeology, geotechnical evaluations and volcano stratigraphy. Brown is a fellow of the Geological Society of America and a member of the American Geophysical Union, the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, the Seismological Society of America and the Society of Petroleum Engineering.Research Interestsgeophysics; seismology; ground penetrating radar; geotectonicsEnergy and the EnvironmentEnergy SystemsSignal and Image ProcessingSustainable Energy SystemsNatural HazardsGeophysics and SeismologyEnergy, Mineral and Water ResourcesTectonics and Structural GeologyTeaching InterestsEAS 1220 Earthquake! in the Spring.
