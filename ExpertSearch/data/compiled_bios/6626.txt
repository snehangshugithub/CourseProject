The research interests of the Teresa Head-Gordon lab embraces this large scope of science drivers through the development of general computational models and methodologies applied to molecular liquids, macromolecular assemblies, protein biophysics, and homogeneous, heterogeneous catalysis and biocatalysis. She has a continued and abiding interest in the development and application of complex chemistry models, accelerated sampling methods, coarse graining and multiscale techniques, analytical and semi-analytical solutions to the Poisson-Boltzmann Equation, and advanced self-consistent field (SCF) solvers and SCF-less methods for many-body physics. The methods and models developed in her lab are widely disseminated through many community software codes that scale on high performance computing platforms.
