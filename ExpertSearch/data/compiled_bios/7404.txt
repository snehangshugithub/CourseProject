Research Interests The evolution of high temperature and/or low density plasmas is determined by the six-dimensional Vlasov-Maxwell system. Solving such a high-dimensional system numerically is very computationally intensive, currently requiring simulations to be run on the largest supercomputers in the world. My research focuses on the development of asymptotic models and advanced numerical methods designed to improve the efficiency of plasma simulation codes. The main applications of interest are in magnetically confined fusion plasmas, and in particle accelerator beams. Selected Publications L.F. Ricketson and A.J.
