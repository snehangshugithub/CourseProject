Her teaching areas include motor speech, voice, and cognitive-communicative disorders; counseling; and therapeutic methods. Petroi has taken initiative to facilitate interprofessional learning opportunities with other departments for the purpose of bridging the gap between academia and clinical practice and providing students with enriching interactive experiences. She seeks to integrate faith and learning to help aspiring speech-language pathology students think critically about how to approach patient-centered care from a Christian perspective. Petrois clinical and research interests include differential diagnosis and understanding brain-behavior relationships of motor speech/language disorders, comparing clinical findings across various domains, examining components of normal and disordered swallowing, and collaborating across disciplines for teaching, research, and quality care purposes. Her current research is focused on correlating clinical findings with neuroimaging data in the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia. Petroi completed a post-doctoral fellowship at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, and has extensive clinical experience in medical speech-language pathology.
