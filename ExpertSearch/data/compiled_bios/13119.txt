He is a strong believer of zero-emission, sustainable, resilient transit systems that support the rise of smart communities. His research focuses on the utilization of disruptive technologies in public transit networks with emphasis on electric and autonomous technologies. In particular, he investigates the operational efficiency of disruptive technologies in public transit networks with emphasis on; operational reliability, environmental assessment, and total cost of ownership. His research also investigates the systemic impacts of the transit system on utility grid and energy demand. Education Ph.D. (Ulster), M.A.Sc. (Rome), B.Eng.

CIVENG 6T04 Transportation Engineering II - Modelling Transit and ITS Graduate CIVENG 6T04 / Transportation Engineering II - Modelling Transit and ITS 3 unit(s) An imperative to developing and maintaining a sustainable urban transportation system lies in 'mobility' - recognizing the origin and destination epicentres within a Region and ensuring that there are multiple, viable alternatives for commuters. Traffic and transit modelling is the key to achieving this goal. The modelling of traffic/transit scenarios can facilitate the efficient operation of existing infrastructure as well as the planning and design of future sustainable strategies. This course is intended as a continuation of 3K03 - Introduction to Transportation Engineering with more complex traffic signal modelling, an introduction to Transit Engineering and ITS algorithm development.
