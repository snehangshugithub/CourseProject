Green Street Urbana, IL 61801 (217) 333-6183 palbin@illinois.edu Research AreasAnalysisDifferential Equations and Applied Mathematics (DEAM)Geometry and Topology Edit Your Profile Professor Visit Website BiographyI was born in California and grew up in Houston and Mexico City. I got my undergraduate degree in applied mathematics and worked in financial risk management in Mexico before getting my PhD under Rafe Mazzeo at Stanford. I did postdocs at MIT, NYU/IAS, and Paris before coming to UIUC in 2011. Research DescriptionMy research is in geometric analysis. I am particularly interested in analytic representations of topological invariants, analysis on non-compact or singular spaces, spectral geometry, heat kernels, and Dirac operators.
