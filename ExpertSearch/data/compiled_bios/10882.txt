Currently, the group is building two experiments - the Double Chooz neutrino oscillation experiment and the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) dark matter experiment. Both experiments are scheduled to begin taking data in 2011. In addition, Bob is Co-Spokesperson of the Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment, a next generation neutrino experiment designed to look for neutrino CPV violation, measure the mass ordering, detect supernovae, and make precision measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters. During his career, he has made many fundamental measurements and discoveries. These include: (1) detection of neutrinos from SN1987A, (2) first unambiguous discovery of neutrino oscillations, (3) first measurement of the solar neutrino flux to high precision, and (4) first measurement of the energy dependence predicted by neutrino oscillations.
