Arjun Krishnan Teaching Research Home Blog Sorry, you need Javascript on to email me. Arjun Krishnan Welcome to my homepage! Im an Assistant Professor at the University of Rochester. I study probability theory. Broadly speaking, Im interested in strongly correlated models inspired by statistical physics, and in particular growth models in the so-called KPZ class. I was previously a Wiley Assistant Professor/Lecturer at the University of Utah, and a Fields postdoctoral fellow at the Fields Institute in Toronto. My PhD is from the Courant Institute at New York University. My undergraduate degree is from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, and I have a masters degree from the University of Michigan. Both my undergraduate and masters degrees are in Mechanical Engineering. My interests gradually percolated from engines to mathematics over the course of these degrees. More information may be found in my CV. I have research projects for both undergraduates and graduate students. I can be contacted at Sorry, you need Javascript on to email me. .
