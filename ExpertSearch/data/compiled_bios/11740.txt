Neuroscience, University of Maryland Baltimore County, 2003M.S. Pharmacology, University of Rochester, 2007Ph.D. Pharmacology, University of Rochester, 2011 Postdoc Human Genetics, Stanford University, 2015 "We leverage natural genetic variation and data-driven approaches to identify new risk factors and treatments for cardiovascular disease." Clint Miller Clint Miller studies the geneticand environmental risk factors for coronary artery disease and other complex cardiovascular diseases using a combination of large-scale multi-omics profiling andgenetic and drug perturbations. He is an Assistant Professor in Public Health Sciences and a resident member of the Center for Public Health Genomics.He is also a member of the Data Science Institute, Robert Berne Cardiovascular Institute, and holdssecondary appointments in Biomedical Engineering andBiochemistry and Molecular Genetics. He joined UVA in 2017. Clint was previously an Instructor at Stanford University in Cardiovascular Medicine from 2015-2017. Heearned his PhD in Pharmacology at the University of Rochester withChen Yaninvestigatingcyclic nucleotide signaling pathways in the heartand completedhis postdoctoral fellowshipin human genetics and genomics at Stanford University withTom Quertermous. There he investigated the regulatory mechanisms of coronary artery disease loci identified fromgenome-wide associationstudies. The Miller Labstudies the geneticand environmental risk factors for coronary artery disease and other complex cardiovascular diseases using a combination of large-scale multi-omics profiling andgenetic and drug perturbations. They integrate computational andfunctionalgenomicanalyses, vascular biology andsystems pharmacology approaches to study causalregulatory networks driving the disease process. Their goal is to identify novelmarkers to better classify patients with cardiovascular disease as well as inform tailoredtreatmentsthat target dysregulated pathways in the vessel wall.
