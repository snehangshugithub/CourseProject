After completing his Ph.D., Dr. Hindes was a postdoctoral fellow at the Graduate Center of The City University of New York. His research interests are in number theory, specifically, arithmetic geometry and arithmetic dynamics (the study of arithmetic aspects of discrete dynamical systems on algebraic varieties). I enjoy mathematics foremost for its beauty, which flows from the inventiveness it takes to solve a mathematical problem. Moreover, there is a certain freedom in its abstract nature - in mathematics, when we dont like the rules of a certain game, then we may simply change them. Perhaps Hermann Weyl said it best when he said, My work has always tried to unite the truth with the beautiful, but when I had to choose one or the other, I usually chose the beautiful. In this way, mathematics is as much an art as it is a science.
