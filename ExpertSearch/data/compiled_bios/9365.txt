Green Street Urbana, IL 61801 (217) 244-9278 psdey@illinois.edu Research AreasProbability Edit Your Profile Assistant Professor BiographyI obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics in 2010 from UC Berkeley under the supervision of Sourav Chatterjee and Steve Evans. I was a Courant Instructor and Simons Fellow in the Department of Mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, NYU in 2010-2013 and a Harrison Early-Career Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Warwick in 2013-2014 before joining the faculty in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2014. I did my undergraduate and masters study from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata with specialization in Mathematical Statistics and Probability. Research DescriptionMy research lies in the field of Probability Theory and its interactions with models of Statistical Physics. In particular I am interested in First and Last passage percolation, Random growth models, Stein's method, Concentration inequalities, Spin glasses, Random Graphs and Random Matrices.
