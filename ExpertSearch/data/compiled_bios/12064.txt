People Dr Faiyaz Doctor People Dr Faiyaz Doctor Senior Lecturer School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CSEE) Email fdocto@essex.ac.uk Location 4B.525, Colchester Campus Academic support hours Module Supervisor for CE713 Internet of Things Technology Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Biography I am an academic, innovator and applied technology specialist with over 15 years of experience in the development and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in research and commercial areas. Presently I am a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) with the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering at the University of Essex, U. K where I am founder and head the Intelligent Connected Societies Group, part of the Centre for Computational Intelligence and am member of the Intelligent Embedded Systems and Environments Group. I am also a Director at Interactive Coventry Ltd, steering committee member for the Creative Science Foundation and currently appointed as an Eastern Arc thematic champion for culture, connection and creativity in science and health. Over the course of my career, I have worked in both industrial and academia developing and applying nature inspired Computational Intelligence (CI) approaches for human centred systems related to various real-world domains such as smart environments, elderly care, energy optimization, industrial automation, information analysis, decision-making simulation, control systems and affective computing. I am interested in the development of user and task centred intelligently orchestrated and context aware pervasive computing systems. I am particularly interested in explainable and approximate reasoning techniques based on type-1 and type-2 fuzzy systems, hybrid computational intelligence techniques for real world applications, intelligent agents and AI driven virtual, augmented, and mixed reality systems. I have successfully led and co-led several projects funded through Innovate UK, Harvard University, and the Newton Fund. I am currently institutional lead on a project funded by the Royal Academy of Engineers on capacity building in sub-Saharan Africa and supervising several KTP projects with leading UK businesses. I have published over 80 papers in peer-reviewed international journals, conferences, workshops, books and have two patents. I am an associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems and have guest edited several journal special issues most notably in the Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments and the IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence and MDPI Remote Sensing. I am a fellow of the Higher Education Academy, member of the IEEE and serve on the IEEE Computational Intelligence Societys Emergent Technologies Technical Committee.
