Current research interests are in the areas of micro and nanofabrication, especially MEMS. Recent projects include design and fabrication of microrelays, micromirrors, and a variety of MEMS sensors, with an emphasis on nanoscale material properties and contacts. Current projects include design of microrelay contacts, fabrication of MEMS testbeds for nanoscale materials testing, design and fabrication of magnetic sensors, and development of microfabricated surface-energy driven nanoscale alignment systems. To carry out this work, Professor McGruer directs the Microfabrication Laboratory and the Scanning Electron Microscopy Facility.Professor McGruer received the degrees of B.S. in physics and M.S. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in 1977, 1979, and 1983 from Michigan State University. From 1983 to 1987, at Sperry Semiconductor Operations, he was responsible for ion implant/diffusion process development for 0.8 and 1.25 micron CMOS technologies, participated in the startup of a new fabrication facility, and investigated rapid thermal and oxidation of silicon for MOS gate dielectrics.Research Interests:MEMSMOEMSmicrofabricationmicrosystemsmicrorelaymicrospectrometeroptical switchingoptical MEMSEducationPhD, Michigan State University, 1983Honors & AwardsSren Buus Outstanding Research Award, College of EngineeringJoel and Spira Excellence in Teaching Award Toggle Accordion Research Research OverviewMEMS, NEMS, RF MEMS; nanotechnology; micro/nanofabrication; microsystems; microrelay; nanoswitch; microspectrometer; microfluidics; organic FETs, organic solar cellsSelected Research ProjectsPLASMID (Plasmonic Microelectromechanical Infrared Digitizer), Zero-Power Sensor Co-Principal Investigator, Defense Advanced Research Projects AgencyZero Power Sensors (ZePS), RF Wake-up Co-Principal Investigator, Defense Advanced Research Projects AgencyCollege Research Initiatives Advancing Nanotechnology through Innovation in Materials Engineering link BioMachine Integration link Department Research Areas Microsystems, Materials & Devices Toggle Accordion Publications Selected PublicationsZhu, William Z, Assylbekova, Meruyert,McGruer, Nicol E(2021).Limitations on MEMS design resulting from random stress gradient variations in sputtered thin films.Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering, 31(4),045004.10.1088/1361-6439/ABDE90W.Z.
