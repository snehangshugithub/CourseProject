Ram Ramasubramanian is the Vice President for Research at the University of Virginia. Prior to his appointment at UVA, he was the program director for the Engineering Research Centers program at the National Science Foundation and the D.W. Reynolds Distinguished Professor and department chair of Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University, with a joint faculty appointment as professor of bioengineering. Prior to arriving at Clemson, Ramasubramanian was the lead program director for the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship program at the National Science Foundation from 2009 to 2012. Before that, he served as a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at North Carolina State University and research associate for the James River Corporation (now Georgia-Pacific) and Syracuse University. His research interests are highly interdisciplinary, at the interface of engineering, biology, physical sciences, and medicine. Specific topics include mechanics of manufacturing processes, constitutive models for short fiber composites, bio-manufacturing and tissue engineering, scalable microfluidics, biomimetics, mechatronics, and biomedical devices. He has been widely published in engineering and biomedical journals and is an associate editor for IEEE Access - The Multidisciplinary Open Access Journal.
