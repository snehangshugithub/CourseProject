People Professor Dariush Mirshekar-Syahkal People Professor Dariush Mirshekar-Syahkal Professor School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CSEE) Email dariush@essex.ac.uk Location 1NW.3.18, Colchester Campus Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Biography Professor Dariush Mirshekar FIET, FHEA and FIEEE, Head of RF & Microwave Research Lab, has several seminal works in modelling, design, fabrication and measurement of microwave and mm-wave circuits and antennas. He has been collaborating with the UK and international communication companies in various capacities. He generalised the spectral domain technique for analysis and design of Microwave and Mm-wave Integrated Circuits (MICs and MMICs). In the field of electromagnetic material characterisation, he has developed a novel noise cancellation technique and a 1D probe array used in quantitative inspection of sensitive metallic components and structures in aircrafts, off-shore platforms and power plants. His research projects on RF filters for cellular communications has led to the development of compact multi-mode dielectric loaded filters for European commercial satellite communications. He has worked on mm-wave radio-fibre systems for wideband wireless distribution of communication feeds to homes and offices. In this connection, he has developed high gain microstrip antenna arrays, broadband mm-wave tapered slot antennas, and UWB bow-tie antennas on Silicon. Also, he has developed an intelligent antenna, Superloop Antenna, for boosting weak TV signals for commercial applications. He has invented compact thin-substrate beam adaptive planar spiral antenna free from phase shifters leading to further development of phase-shifter free switched-beam planar antennas in his group for communication capacity boast. His further research has been on the development of LC (liquid crystal) based RF devices, modelling and characterisation of nematic LCs, and development of steerable LC antennas all at mm-wave frequencies. His further key contributions are in the field of super compact filters for UWB technology, amplifier linearization, and numerical modelling in electromagnetics. His current research embodies microwave and mm-wave full-duplex radio system and NFC (near field communication) at mm-waves for 5G and beyond. He holds five patents, has numerous publications including a book (Spectral Domain Method for Microwave Integrated Circuits), two book chapters (entitled Advances in Crack Length Measurement with ACFM Technique, and Loop Antennas) and papers in IEEE Transactions, IET Proceedings and in the very prestigious Proceedings of the Royal Society.
