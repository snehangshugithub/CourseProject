Guarente Novartis Professor of Biology Leonard P. Guarente looks at mammal, mouse, and human brains to understand the genetic underpinning of aging and age-related diseases like Alzheimers. 617-253-6965 Phone 68-280 Office leng@mit.edu Email Lab Website Mary Gallagher Assistant 617-258-7360 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1978, Harvard University SB, 1974, Biology, MIT Research Summary We combine comprehensive bioinformatics analyses with functional analyses of pathways and genes to study aging in humans and mice. We apply these approaches to identify the major pathways and genes involved in the aging of certain brain regions. We are also studying muscular dystrophy and muscle loss with aging. Ultimately, our findings may guide studies in other organs and lead to a systemic understanding of mammalian aging.
