Chemical Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2010Ph.D. Chemical Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2013Post-Doc Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, 2013-2016 "We design biomaterials to better understand the dynamic reciprocity between cells and their environment during disease progression and tissue regeneration." Steven R. Caliari, Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering Steven joined the faculty of the University of Virginia in August 2016 as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering with a secondary appointment in the Department of Biomedical Engineering. Prior to joining UVAhe was an NIH Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania. Steven completed his B.S. in Chemical Engineering at the University of Florida and received both his M.S. and Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His lab designs, synthesizes, and characterizes new biomaterials to explore the dynamic interplay between cells and their microenvironment, applying these platforms to address fundamental human health challenges in understanding disease and engineering tissues. Steven recently received theNIH (NIGMS) Maximizing Investigators Research Award (MIRA) and NSF CAREER Award. He was also named a 2021 Young Innovator in Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering. His lab is grateful for generous support from the NIH, DoD, NSF, V Foundation, and UVA-Coulter Translational Research Partnership.
