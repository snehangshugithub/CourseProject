Von Helmholtz Career Development Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Assistant Professor of Institute for Medical Engineering and Science Email tami@mit.edu Faculties Climate, Environment & Life Science Research Website http://lieberman.science/EducationBA, Biological Sciences, Northwestern University, 2009PhD, Systems Biology, Harvard University, 2014Research InterestsProfessor Lieberman studies microbial evolution in real time, including the evolution of antibiotic resistance and evolution during infection. Her lab is interested in understanding the molecular determinants of colonization success in complex environments and enabling the precise manipulations of microbiomes in the clinic and the environment.Selected PublicationsLieberman, T.
