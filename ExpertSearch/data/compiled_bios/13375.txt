In both areas, the organism studied is Escherichia coli due to its sophisticated genetics and simple lipid composition. However we also study a variety of gram positive bacteria. We have studied mechanisms that regulate the composition of the membrane phospholipids of E. coli and are currently concerned how this organism regulates lipid synthesis such that it is neither "fat nor lean." Although, E. coli is the paradigm for bacterial lipid synthesis there are bacteria that are missing genes that are in essential for E. coli growth. We are in process of figuring out which proteins these bacteria use in place of those used by E. coli. This has practical consequences because bacterial fatty acid synthesis is the target of several newly developed antibiotics. We have found that two key coenzymes, how lipoic acid and biotin, found in all three domains of life require the fatty acid synthetic pathway for their synthesis. We have determined how E. coli makes these coenzymes and are now expanding into the pathways found in other bacteria.
