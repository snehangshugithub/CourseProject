After spending several years as the head preparator and assistant curator of herpetology at a natural history museum, she joined Prof. Michael Coens lab and earned her M.S. in zoology in 2010 and Ph.D. in zoology in 2014. She joined the Carthage faculty in 2015. Prof. Dassows research focuses on computational analyses of animal vocalizations, exploring correlates with human linguistic phenomena at the phonetic, morphological, and syntactic levels. This work has centered on understanding the vocal communication systems of wild and captive white-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar); however, she has examined other species as well, ranging across a variety of taxa including cetaceans, bats, canids, and songbirds. By combining aspects of ecology, linguistics, computer science, and information theory, we are able to gain new insights into the communicative abilities of white-handed gibbons and demonstrate previously unrecognized complexity and structure in their vocal communication system.

Prior to focusing my research on bioacoustics and animal behavior, I studied the population dynamics of white-tailed deer, gray wolves, Blandings turtles, painted turtles, snapping turtles, trumpeter swans, a variety of waterfowl, raptors and songbirds, porcupines, and central Wisconsin dragonflies. I have also examined the impact of temperature variation on the sex ratios of hatchling fresh-water river turtles in the Amazon rainforest of Brazil. Hylobatidae Lesser apes The primary species I work with is the white-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar). This species is native to Southeast Asia, it lives in female-led territorial groups and it primarily communicates by using a diverse set of vocalizations. To date, I have been able to identify and describe the vocal repertoire of this species, which consists of 27 statistically distinctive acoustic units. I have also been able to identify motivational and referential sequences of their predator warning calls. Current research efforts are focused on understanding great call and coda development between wild and captive populations. Canidae Gray wolves In collaboration with the Timber Wolf Information Network, we are exploring the possibility of tracking gray wolves (Canis lupus), by recording their howls and then analyzing these calls to search for acoustic markers that can identify individuals. To date, we have been able to cluster sets of howls accurately and our future challenges will include adding more individuals to our data set, tracking vocal changes over time, and correctly classifying unlabeled howls. Hominidae Western lowland gorillas University of Mississippi Anthropology Professor Dr. Carolyn Freiwald and I are collaborating on a project to conduct the first formal study of lowland gorilla behavior at the Memphis Zoo. The goal of this research is to determine what the activity budgets are for each gorilla. To accomplish this, we are building an ethogram of various foraging, locomotor, and agonistic behaviors between the four gorillas currently housed there. Turtle Robots Vocal production in freshwater turtles is an emerging field of study. Several species of turtles have already been recorded, vocal repertoires described and in the case of one species, maternal care has been associated with vocal interactivity with hatchlings. Current challenges include tracking hatchling turtles once they leave their nesting beach. Their small size makes radio transmitters prohibitive, but a turtle-tracking robot could follow a turtle and record the vocal interactivity between hatchlings. The main goal of this research is to build and deploy an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to track a hatchling turtle and record its vocal interactivity. Student Projects I advise students on undergraduate research related to each of my on-going projects. I am happy to speak with prospective students about their ideas and interests.
