Mechanical Engineering 2016 University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Ph.D. Mechanical Engineering Research InterestsBiological materials have an unparalleled ability to sense, process, and respond to their environment in real-time. The Raman Lab creates adaptive biological materials powered by assemblies of living cells for applications ranging from medicine to machines. Currently the Raman Lab is focused on engineering biological actuators.Humans and other biological creatures navigate unpredictable and dynamic environments by combining compliant mechanical actuators (skeletal muscle) with neural control and sensory feedback. Abiotic actuators have yet to match their biological counterparts in their ability to autonomously sense and adapt their form and function to changing surroundings. The Raman Lab uses biological materials and engineering tools to build living neuromuscular tissues. These biological actuators help us understand and manipulate the architecture and function of the biological motor control system. Our goal is to help restore mobility to those who have lost it after disease or trauma, and to deploy biological actuators as functional components in machines. BioRitu Raman, PhDis the dArbeloff Career Development Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT. Her lab is centered on engineering adaptive living materials for applications in medicine and machines. The Raman Labs current focus is building neuromuscular actuators to restore mobility and power robots. Prof. Raman has received several recognitions for scientific innovation, including being named a Kavli Fellow by the National Academy of Sciences and being named to the Forbes 30 Under 30 and MIT Technology Review 35 Innovators Under 35 lists. She is the author of the upcoming MIT Press book Biofabrication.She is passionate about increasing diversity in STEM and has championed many initiatives to empower women in science, including being named a AAAS IF/THEN ambassador and founding the Women in Innovation and STEM Database at MIT (WISDM). Prof. Raman received her BS from Cornell University and her PhD as an NSF Graduate Research Fellow at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She completed her postdoctoral research with Prof. Bob Langer at MIT, funded by a LOral USA For Women in Science Fellowship and a Ford Foundation Fellowship from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.
