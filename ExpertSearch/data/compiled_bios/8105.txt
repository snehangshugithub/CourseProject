He worked for the DuPont Company as a senior scientist in Corporate R&D for 12 years. Professor Shah joined the University of Delaware in 1999 where he currently holds joint appointments in the Departments of Materials Science and Engineering and Physic and Astronomy. He is also the Director of Energy and Environment Policy Program (ENEP) in the Joseph Biden Jr. School of Public Policy and Administration. As a trained engineer, his focus is to bridge the disciplines of policy with engineering through his research on renewable GHG (farm gases) and distributed off-grid power. He is the recipient of the Excellence in Outreach and Global Community Services Award, College of Engineering, University of Delaware; the Madhuri and Jagdish N. Sheth International Alumni Award for Community Engagement, University of Illinois; and the Mentor Award, Society of Vacuum Coaters. His research focuses on designing new materials for water, energy, and environmental applications; distributed power optimization; renewable GHG; and energy and environmental ethics and policy. He has published more than 250 papers in these areas and has 6 related patents.
