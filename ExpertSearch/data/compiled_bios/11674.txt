Before joining the faculty at the University of Waterloo, she obtained her doctoral degree from the University of Toronto, Canada, M.A.Sc. from the Cracow University of Technology, Poland and she worked as a consulting structural engineer. Professor Polak is a member of the American Society of Civil Engineering ASCE, International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering IABSE, Transportation Research Board TRB (committee AKB10 - Innovative Highway Structures and Appurtenances) and a Fellow of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineering CSCE and the American Concrete Institute ACI, where she is a member of ACI committees: 440 (Fiber Reinforced Polymer), 445 (Shear and Torsion), 564 (3-D Printing), and 435 (Deflections). She is a recipient of prestigious Humboldt Research fellowships in 1999, 2006, 2015 and 2019. She was a visiting professor at the University of Stuttgart, Technical University of Berlin and the University of Wuppertal in Germany, and Cracow University of Technology and Silesian University of Technology, Poland. She is a registered professional engineer in Ontario PEO, Canada. Professor Polaks research is in the area of structural engineering and mechanics, constitutive modelling of materials, infrastructure retrofit and monitoring, and nonlinear finite element analysis. Her work has a particular focus on structural concrete; in this regard, some current projects are: punching shear in reinforced concrete slabs, non-destructive detection of damage, fiber reinforced polymers in construction, and 3-D printing of concrete. She works also in an interdisciplinary research group involved in analysis and testing polymeric materials used in construction. Her research includes both large scale laboratory testing and numerical analysis.Research InterestsStructural EngineeringCharacterization of construction materialsPunching shear in reinforced concrete slabsStructural concrete reinforced with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) bars3-D printing of concrete structuresInfrastructure retrofit and monitoringNondestructive detection of damageStrength and durability of polymers and polymeric composites for constructionTrenchless EngineeringEducation1992, Doctorate, PhD, University of Toronto1984, Master's, MSc, Cracow University of Technology1982, Bachelor's, BSc, Cracow University of TechnologyCourses*CIVE 400 - Civil Eng'g Des Project 1Taught in 2016, 2018CIVE 414 - Structural Concrete DesignTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021CIVE 603 - Reinforced Concrete MechanicsTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Graduate StudiesCurrently considering applications from graduate students.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
