Goodwin Ave Urbana, IL 61801 Emeritus Professor of Molecular and Integrative Physiology Education B.A. 1965 Wabash College PhD. 1969 Stanford Postdoc. 1969-72 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Present: Role of nuclear receptors in regulation metabolism. Past: Gene regulation and cellular localization mechanisms of cytrochromes P450. Since retirement in 2012, I have been collaborating with Jongsook (Kim) Kemper on studies that examine the role of nuclear receptors and epigenomic factors in the regulation of metabolism in liver and adipose tissue. See the Jongsook Kemper site for details. Prior to retirement I studied the cytochromes P450 (P450) which comprise a superfamily of hemoproteins which are involved in the oxidative metabolism of many endogenous and exogenous compounds. My primary interests were the mechanisms by which the expression of these genes are regulated, particularly by phenobarbital, and the mechanisms of targeting and retention of P450s in the endoplasmic reticulum.
