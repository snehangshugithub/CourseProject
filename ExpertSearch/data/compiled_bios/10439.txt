My book, The Odd Man Karakozov: Imperial Russia, Modernity, and the Birth of Terrorism (Cornell UP, 2009), is a cultural/micro-history of the first attempted assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1866. I am also the co-editor of the forthcoming Oxford Handbook of the History of Terrorism. The past few years my research and writing were focused on the study of temporality (especially as related to terrorism), and I am currently at work on a political/cultural-intellectual history of the 1969 Manson murders. My other research interests include literature and the arts; historiography and historical method; political thought; and Russian, German, and European cultural-intellectual history. Recent courses taught include: History of Terrorism, History of Law: Great Trials (with Holly Case and Paul Friedland), Thinking about History with the Manson Murders and, at the graduate level, Modernity and Modernism: East and West, History of Time/Time of History, Radicalism: The European Left from 1848-1917, and Key Texts in European Intellectual History.
