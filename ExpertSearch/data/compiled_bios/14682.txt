Environmental Engineering, University of California-Berkeley B.S., Science of Earth Systems, Cornell University B.F.A., Fine Arts, Cornell UniversityResearch InterestsDr Aristildes areas of expertise are in the combined application of experimental and computational tools in chemistry and biochemistry to gain novel molecular insights underlying the dynamics of organics in environmental processes. The goal of the Aristilde Group is to obtain a fundamental understanding of the why and how of the environmental behavior of organics, with implications for nutrient cycling, ecosystem health, agricultural productivity, and environmental biotechnology. Her group seeks to figure out the mechanisms responsible for the physical and biological fates. The current research activities of her group are focused on (i) cellular carbon metabolism of organic substrates in environmental bacteria, (ii) catalytic dynamics of nutrient-cycling extracellular enzymes, (iii) the physical chemistry of biomolecules and organic contaminants in environmental matrices, (iv) molecular ecotoxicological targets of organic contaminants. Aristilde grew up in Port-Au-Prince, Haiti. After emigrating to the U.S., Aristilde enjoyed studying her two passions, art and environmental science, at Cornell University where she completed a dual-degree program with a B.F.A. in Fine Arts and a B.S. in Science of Earth Systems. During her doctoral studies at the University of California-Berkeley, Aristilde worked on the environmental chemistry and toxicology of veterinary antibiotics under the supervision of Dr. Garrison Sposito. Following the completion of her PhD, Aristilde went to Grenoble (France) as an American Fulbright scholar to study different spectroscopic techniques to investigate organo-mineral interactions. She spent three years as a NSF postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University learning how to use molecular biology tools to tackle problems at the interface of environmental chemistry and biological processes. Prof. Aristilde started her faculty career at Cornell University (Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering) as an Assistant Professor in 2012 and promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in 2018. Prof. Aristilde joined the Northwestern Faculty in 2019.Selected Publications*Solhtalab M., *Klein A.R., Aristilde L.
