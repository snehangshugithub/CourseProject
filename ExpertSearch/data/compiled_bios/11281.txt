Weeks Professor President, American Dairy Science Association Dr. Dahl conducts applied and basic research with direct impact on animal production and health. Specifically, his program focuses on understanding the physiological impact of management interventions, notably photoperiod and heat stress abatement, at various stages of the lactation cycle, in an attempt to harness that knowledge to optimize cow health and performance. The fundamental aspects of Geoffs research has led to application in other agriculturally important species including sheep, goats and pigs. Programs Research Research Summary Dr. Dahl conducts applied and basic research with direct impact on animal production and health. Specifically, his program focuses on understanding the physiological impact of management interventions, notably photoperiod and heat stress abatement, at various stages of the lactation cycle, in an attempt to harness that knowledge to optimize cow health and performance. The fundamental aspects of Geoffs research has led to application in other agriculturally important species including sheep, goats and pigs. Teaching Dr. Dahl has taught courses on dairy management, general and lactation physiology and endocrinology at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Most recently he taught Advanced Physiology of Lactation in Domestic Animals (ANS 6702). He is also responsible for oversight of the undergraduate and graduate programs in the Department, working closely with the Undergraduate Program Coordinator and Graduate Program Director.
