French Bio B.S. in Biochemistry from Louisiana State University in 1982Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Louisiana State University in 1987Post-Doc Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX/NIH/Dept. of Cell Biology from 1987-91 "Our research has impact in: 1) uncovering disease mechanisms, 2) evaluating novel therapies, and 3) developing new imaging methods for diagnostics." Brent A. French, Ph.D., Professor of Biomedical Engineering Brent A. French combines advanced methods of targeted drug and gene delivery with biomedical imaging in vivo to explore novel targets and treatment strategies in cardiovascular disease and cancer. Research interests of the Molecular Bioengineering Lab focus on developing new, more effective strategies for treating and preventing human disease. In parallel, we develop novel diagnostic imaging methods to better understand the progression/regression of disease and the impact of novel therapies on specific disease targets. A highly-collaborative, interdisciplinary approach is used to integrate recent technical advances in multiple fields with our highly translational research. In particular, cutting-edge imaging techniques such as MRI, PET and ultrasound are used to expedite research by providing accurate measures of novel therapies against cardiovascular disease and cancer. Research Interests Medical and Molecular Imaging Cell and Molecular Biomechanics Targeted Drug and Gene Delivery Cardiovascular Disease In the News Ivy Foundation Backs 14 Covid Translational Research Projects Ivy Foundation Backs 14 Covid Translational Research Projects Projects range from development of biosensors, artificial intelligence for testing, vaccine development, novel treatment options, and better data analytics to predict the spread of the virus.
