His research accomplishments include a solution to the Schottky problem (a characterization of Jacobian varieties) in terms of KP equations (Novikov conjecture) [1], establishing the solvability of soliton equations and supersymmetric generalizations [2], discovery of the equivalence between Strebel differentials and Grothendieck's dessns d'enfants [3], a proof of the Bouchard-Mario conjecture on Hurwitz numbers [4], and a solution to the conjecture of Gaiotto on conformal limit and opers of Beilinson and Drinfeld [5].
