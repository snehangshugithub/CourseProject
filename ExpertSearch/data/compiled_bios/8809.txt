Chemical, Nuclear, and Thermal Engineering MS, Heat and Mass Transfer 1988 UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO, Dept. Applied Mechanics and Engineering Sciences PhD, Fluid Dynamics Research InterestsThe activities of our research group are in the broad area of heat and mass transfer, thermodynamics, and fluid dynamics. Our focus is on technologies for desalination of seawater and brackish water, remediation of various waste waters, and recycling of water, with increased energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact as core objectives. This work includes thermodynamic cycle analysis, transport processes in components, solar-energy driven systems, and both thermal and membrane separations. Past activities in our lab have included: convection and fluid dynamics in liquid jet impingement; high heat flux engineering; thermally stratified turbulent flow and instrumentation; electronics thermal management; and thermally driven instabilities. BioJohn H. Lienhard V is the Abdul Latif Jameel Professor andthefounding Director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab at MIT (J-WAFS). During more than three decades on the MIT faculty, Lienhards research and educational efforts have focused onheat and mass transfer, water purification anddesalination, and thermodynamics. He has also filled a number of administrative roles at MIT. Lienhards research on water purification has spanned a wide range of technologies for desalination and waste brine management, with a focus on energy efficiency and environmental protection. Lienhard has directly supervised more than 90 graduate theses and postdoctoral associates and is author of more than 300 peer-reviewed publications. He has been issued more than 35 US patents, most of which have been commercialized through several start-up companies. Lienhard is a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and a Fellow of the American Society of Thermal and Fluid Engineers (ASTFE). He is a recipient of the 1988 National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award, the 1992 SAE Teetor Award, a 1997 R&D 100 Award, the 2012 ASME Technical Communities Globalization Medal, the 2015 ASME Heat Transfer Memorial Award, and the 2019 ASME Edward F.
