We are closely connected to and affiliated with our sister groups in Astrophysics and Particle Physics. The group members work closely with Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, especially the Nuclear Science Division. Our research is carried out at a variety of locations and within several national collaborations. These include the Canadian deep underground laboratory SNOLab and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven. Major collaborations include the double beta decay experiment SNO+, CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events), the Phenix and sPhenix detectors at RHIC, the SciDAC (Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing) collaboration CaliforniaLattice (CalLat), the UC MultiCampus Research Initiative on Dark Matter, the dark matter search experiment DEAP, the UC Research Program on Frontiers of Neutrino Physics and Nuclear Astrophysics, and the Department of Energy Topical Collaboration on Neutrinos and Nucleosynthesis in Hot and Dense Matter.
