Professional website for Kathryn Huff Research group website for the Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles Group Education University of Wisconsin-Madison, Ph.D., Nuclear Engineering, 2013 University of Chicago, B.A., Physics, 2008 Biography Dr. Kathryn D. Huff is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering and and a Blue Waters Assistant Professor with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow with both the Nuclear Science and Security Consortium and the Berkeley Institute for Data Science at the University of California - Berkeley. As a PhD student, she helped to reimagine the GENIUSv2 fuel cycle simulator and became the primary developer of the Cyclus simulator in its initial phase. In addition, she collaborated with the Systems Analysis group at Idaho National Laboratory to develop the Fuel Cycle Simulator Software Requirements that defined the goals and expectations for the Next Generation Fuel Cycle Simulator. She received her PhD in Nuclear Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in August 2013 as a student of Professor Paul P.H. Wilson. Her undergraduate degree was in Physics from the University of Chicago. Her PhD dissertation and postdoctoral work both focused on development of software for nuclear engineering applications such as the Cyclus simulator, PyNE, and extensions to MOOSE. She is particularly interested in robust modeling and simulation of advanced reactors emphasizing scientific software engineering best practices.
