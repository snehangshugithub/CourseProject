Applications of FPGAs including wireless communications, machine learning and data privacy.Reconfigurable and GPU Computing LaboratoryIn the Reconfigurable and GPU Computing Laboratory (RCL) we research how to use hardware accelerators such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for a wide variety of applications. Our interest is in developing tools, libraries and interfaces that make accelerators easier to use. Our work helps speed up wireless networking, IoT, medical imaging, security and privacy applications, in many cases taking theoretical algorithm advances and making them practically viable for the first time.
