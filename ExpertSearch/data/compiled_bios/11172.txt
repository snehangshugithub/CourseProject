My research aims to answer three questions: 1) Globalization has brought people to a more mobile and diverse life. How does this change impact peoples cognition, behaviors and beliefs? 2) How do people mentally construct their social worldsi.e., their social networksaccording to various psychological and situational factors (e.g. gender, status, foreign environment) and how does that contribute to inequality? 3) What are the socio-ecological mechanisms that underlie cross-cultural differences in trust, reciprocity and social perception? My work has appeared in leading academic journals such as Social Psychology and Personality Science and Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes. Teaching Interests: I teach Negotiation and Organizational Behaviors at both the MBA and undergraduate levels.
