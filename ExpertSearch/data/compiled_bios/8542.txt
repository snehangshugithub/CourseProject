Active Informatics Projects Biomedical Informatics Core of the Institute of Translational Health Sciences [NIH CTSA, Semopr Informatics Advisor, Biomedical Informatics Core] Informatics Goal: We propose to build the NW Clinical Research Informatics Collaborative, which will be a single, shared resource that that offers existing and newly developed clinical research informatics tools and services to address needs of our users. This resource will rely on a central web portal, central help desk, and a shared set of tools that we will develop. We will also partner with the University of Washington Health Sciences Library to create a strong support environment for informatics tools at our hub. Evolving our Partnership: The CSER2 Centralized Support Coordinating Center [NIH NHGRI, Jarvik, Veenstra, Nickerson, Fullerton, Tarczy-Hornoch (MPI)] Our overall goal in this coordinating center proposal is to enhance the effectiveness of Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research (CSER) Consortium studies by assuring effective coordination and logistic support, moving cross-consortium work forward, identifying synergies that increase the scientific value of the individual projects, and leading outcomes efforts. Customizing Value-based Methods to Prioritize Implementation of Pharmacogenomic Clinical Decision Support for Learning Health Systems [AHRQ, Devine PI, Tarczy-Hornoch Significant Contributor] Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is well-positioned to be the first genomics application to realize the promise of precision medicine. Active PGx clinical decision support (PGx-CDS) alerts are proposed as one preferred method for returning PGx test results; the value of providing PGx-CDS alerts has not been formally evaluated. We will create a framework (Aim 1) and publically available web-based tool (Aim 2) to assist Learning Health Systems in investing in PGx-CDSalerts of greatest value to their specific population. Graduate Program in Biomedical and Health Informatics [NIH NLM, Tarczy-Hornoch PI] The Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI) training program at the University of Washington has been designed based on the principle that a key characteristic of successful BHI researchers is the ability to play a leadership role in translating and advancing methods and models from the computing sciences, information sciences and behavioral sciences into tools and solutions for information-related challenges and opportunities faced by care providers, patients and their families, biomedical researchers, and public health providers. This training grant supports stipend and tuition benefits for both pre-doctoral and postdoctoral trainees in the field of Biomedical and Health Informatics.
