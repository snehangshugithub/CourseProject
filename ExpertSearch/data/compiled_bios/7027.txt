Our group is highly collaborative, integrating a diverse array of research interests and multidisciplinary expertise. We take on grand challenges spanning complex dynamics of cell populations, heterogeneous cell decisions, experimental design, and tool development. A common thread that persists among our projects involves uncovering, predicting, and ultimately controlling biological response, particularly in context of disease. To learn more about our ongoing research and interests, please visit www.BagheriLab.com. Neda Bagheri earned her doctorate in Electrical Engineering from the University of California in Santa Barbara. Her focus on control theory and dynamics piqued herinterest in biology. Bagheribelieves that engineering principles can be employed to better understand, predict, and control complex biological functions, and that these principles need to be informed by biology. After completing a postdoc in Biological Engineering at MIT, she joined the Chemical & Biological Engineering faculty at Northwestern University where she startedthe Modeling Dynamic Life Systems (MoDyLS) Lab.In 2019, she was recruited to both the University of Washington where she holds a joint position in Biology and Chemical Engineering and the Allen Institute for Cell Science. In recognition for her research accomplishments and vision, Bagheri was awarded a National Science Foundation CAREER Award (2017), and was honored as a Distinguished Speaker for the Accelerated Discover Forum at IBM Research-Almaden (2018) and for the Mindlin Foundation (2019). She serves on multiple scientific advisory and editorial boards, guiding the frontier of multidisciplinary research.
