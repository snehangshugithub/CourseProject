But youll see it. Like when class ends, and your professor refuses to leave until you get it. Or when their lunch break becomes your mock interview. Or when you skip class and find a concerned email waiting in your inbox. Passion is in their job description. Its contagious. And its why our professors will encourage you as often as they challenge you. Their enthusiasm for your success in college and beyond makes Carthage a very special place. They cheer at athletic and cultural events, and will know you well enough to write stellar letters of recommendation to help you to that next step after graduation. Meet some of our faculty members below,and then ask your admissions representative to introduce you to more professors during your campus visit. You can also learn more about our faculty by visiting our academic departments. Eric Pullin, History and Asian Studies Worried that shed encounter a stuffy professor and somehow invoke his wrath. Amanda Reilly 16 felt the nerves dissipate the minute she metProfessor Eric Pullin. My nerves kept on building, but when I walked into the classroom, instead of seeing what I was expecting, I saw a man telling the punch line to some ridiculous joke, she said. I literally laughed out loud at myself for being so worried and sat down with such a huge grin. Dont let Prof. Pullins spot-on impressions and affinity for assigning nicknames mislead you. Hes serious about history, and hell go the extra mile to convey its lasting messages. Or the extra 4,000 miles. Thats roughly the distance to the beaches of Normandy, one of many stops on a study tour he leads to World War II landmarks in Europe. Thomas Carr, Paleontology While genetically modified dinosaurs rampage across movie screens,Professor Thomas Carrunearths the real science behind the captivating prehistoric beasts. National reporters regularly turn to Prof. Carr, a vertebrate paleontologist, for insights into dino developments especially anything related to T. rex and its closest relatives. But you dont need to subscribe to National Geographic to learn from him. Besides teaching biology classes, he regularly takes a group of students to the Hell Creek Formation in Montana to dig. Much of what they collect is prepared for display just up the road at the Dinosaur Discovery Museum. Kevin Crosby, Physics Under the guidance of Professor Kevin Crosby, space science students lose weight. All of it. For eight straight years, the Carthage Microgravity Team has been selected to fly experiments in zero gravity conditions aboard NASA aircraft. The research is real, with the latest fuel gauging study holding long-term significance for the design of spacecraft and satellite systems. Rather stay on the ground? Prof. Crosby also advises the Carthage RockSat team, which designs and builds flight experiments that are launched aboard a NASA sounding rocket, and leads research in computational physics. Yuri Maltsev, Economics Sure,Professor Yuri Maltsevhas a Ph.D. in labor economics. But thats not why youll want to learn from him. Hes lived at the epicenter of economic policy-making. Before defecting to the United States in 1989, he worked on Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachevs perestroika economic reform package. Later, he briefed U.S. Congress members on national security and foreign economic issues. Millions have seen Prof. Maltsev on CNN, Fox News, or PBS. Carthage students do one better, traveling through southern Africa with him during J-Term to study developing economies and soak in the natural beauty. Kimberly Greene, Art Yes, her biography is correct.Professor Kimberly Greeneearned her bachelors degree in electrical engineering. Then how did she end up teaching art? Well, after 11 years at IBM and other firms in the computer industry left her unfulfilled, she retired and went back to school to pursue her passion. Now she works to inflame that same passion in her students. She says creative ideas come easily to liberal arts students, because theyre always thinking in different ways. Specializing in ceramics, Prof. Greene continues to be a prolific artist. A few times each year, her work is featured in exhibitions from Pennsylvania to Texas. Laura Huaracha, Communication and Digital Media Communicators shouldnt fear science; they should embrace it.Professor Laura Huarachais adamant about that. Having grown up surrounded by 10 acres of maple trees, she believes design can connect people to the beauty of nature. An established photographer and graphic artist, Prof. Huaracha frequently team-teaches courses with science professors. Graphic design and biology students alike learn to join forces. Compelling visuals and text can educate the public about complex research topics better than mountains of data. Whether snapping photos in Arizona or working with a client from the community, students praise her ability to bring what we learn into the practical world.
