He lectured electronics courses at the University of Belgrade from 1992 to 1996. He spent two years with Silicon Systems, Inc., Texas Instruments Storage Products Group, San Jose, CA, working on disk-drive signal processing electronics. In 1999, he joined the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California at Berkeley, where he is now a Professor. His research activities include digital and analog integrated circuit design and VLSI implementation of communications and signal processing algorithms. He is co-author of the book Digital Integrated Circuits: A Design Perspective, 2nd ed, Prentice-Hall, 2003. Dr. Nikoli received the NSF CAREER award in 2003, College of Engineering Best Doctoral Dissertation Prize and Anil K. Jain Prize for the Best Doctoral Dissertation in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California at Davis in 1999, as well as the City of Belgrade Award for the Best Diploma Thesis in 1992. For work with his students and colleagues he has received the best paper awards at the IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, Symposium on VLSI Circuits, IEEE International SOI Conference, European Solid-State Device Research Conference, and the ACM/IEEE International Symposium of Low-Power Electronics.
