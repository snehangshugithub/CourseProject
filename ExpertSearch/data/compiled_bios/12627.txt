His explosion dynamics research group uses theory, numerical simulations and experiments in shock tubes, detonation tubes, flow reactors, and combustion vessels to study themal and spark ignition, flame and detonation propagation in a wide range of fuel-oxidizer systems relevant to propulsion and safety. He works with Prof. Austin' hypesonic flow research group and Prof. Hornung on high-enthalpy flow analyses and experimentation in the GALCIT T5, HET and Ludweig tube facilities. Space-Related Research Chemical propulsion systems; explosion hazards in launch vehicles and spacecraft. Medical Engineering-Related Research Autoinjector dynamics, in-situ measurements, numerical simulation and modeling.
