Students are matched with a faculty member whose area of specialization parallels their career interests. The areas of specialized expertise of individual CALS faculty members affiliated with the Entomology major include: conservation of rare insect species; insect "services" (e.g., pollinations, pest suppression); agroecology; integrated pest management integrated pest management of trees and shrubs; host-plant preferences; ecology and behavior of insect herbivores; invasive species quantitative and molecular genetics of ecologically important traits in insect populations apiculture; honey bee social behavior morphology; phylogeny; systematics; behavior, evolution of primitive bees chemical ecology; insect-plant interactions; plant defense; ecology and evolution of swallowtail butterflies neurophysiological mechanisms of behavior; sensory guidance; evolution; general entomology invertebrate pathology; biology and epizootiology of fungal pathogens affecting insects, and their use for pest control medical entomology; mosquito biology; vector-borne disease ecology integrated pest management, with an emphasis on biological control aquatic entomology; behavior, population, and community ecology of stream insects animal behavior; behavioral ecology; social behavior and predation; spider biology; behavioral aspects of chemical ecology ecology of insect communities and populations; insect-plant interactions biology, ecology, and management of arthropod pests of livestock and poultry; veterinary entomology integrated pest management; biological control; agricultural acarology; biology and management of greenhouse-crop pests biochemistry; genetics, and evolution of insecticide resistance; gene regulation; insecticide neurotoxicology and metabolism pest management; population dynamics; systems ecology insect pest management; insect-plant interactions; plant resistance to insects insect taxonomy; fungus-beetle associations; taxonomy in biodiversity study and conservation Undergraduate StudiesApplication Process Arranging a Visit Contacts Courses and Requirements Faculty Advising Learning Goals and Objectives Opportunities Internship Opportunities Research Honors Program Summer Scholars Program Undergraduate Club Undergraduate Students 2021 Cornell University Secondary menuWeb Accessibility Assistance Privacy Policy Contact Us Log in
