Recipient of the Provosts Faculty Postdoctoral Fellowship, she is currently pursuing research in France as a visiting scientist at the Institut Polytechnique de Bordeaux, ENSEGID. Fernandez will officially join Cornells Earth and Atmospheric Sciences as an Assistant Professor starting January 2022.Research InterestsFernandez is a low temperature geochemist. Her research combines experimental and numerical modeling methods to constrain global water and elemental cycles, their relative feedback and responses to unprecedented land use changes and a rapidly changing global climate. A primary focus in Fernandezs work is the study of fluid-rock interactions at near-surface conditions and how they manifest across various spatiotemporal scales from the mineral-water interface to regional scale river basins. Fernandez relies upon a variety of geochemical tools including stable isotope and trace element environmental tracers to fully characterize the diversity of biogeochemical and hydrologic processes that shape the dynamic landscapes and ecosystems characterizing Earths surface.
