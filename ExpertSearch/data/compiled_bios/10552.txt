He has served on many grant review panels and journal editorial boards. His groupconductstheoretical, computational, and experimental studies on the structure, dynamics, and function of proteins. Areas of special interest include: (1) kinetics and mechanisms of protein association; (2) crowding and emergent properties in cellular environments; (3) structure and function of ion channels and other membrane proteins; and (4) structures and mechanisms of peptide self-assembly.
