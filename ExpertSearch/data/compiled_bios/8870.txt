Biography Martin Wolske is a teaching assistant professor in the School of Information Sciences. His teaching and research seek to foster a rapid shift from a thing-orientation to a person-orientation using problem-posing education and participatory research and co-design approaches, with a special emphasis on community technology platforms and spaces advancing local social justice goals. Since coming to the School in 1995 to work on issues of digital access and equity, he has served a range of boundary spanning roles facilitating community inquiry, shepherding community informatics projects, developing innovative technical resources, and advocating system change. Key roles have included serving as interim director of the Center for Digital Inclusion and director of Prairienet Community Network, and as principal investigator or co-principal on a number of grants related to digital inclusion and digital literacy that have received funding through the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, the American Library Association, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services. He is a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Community Informatics and is the recipient of numerous community awards for service; Library Journals 2011 Teacher of the Year award; and the 2013 University of Illinois Campus Award for Excellence in Public Engagement.
