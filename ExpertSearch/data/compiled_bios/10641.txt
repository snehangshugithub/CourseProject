I also help design games that change peoples lives for the better. I study how games can change the way people think, feel, and behave; my other research interests include creativity, gender, mobile technologies, and community design. Our lab, the OH!Lab, works at the intersection of culture, learning, play, and design in order to create brand new interactions and experiences. Learn more by visiting the OH!Lab website.
