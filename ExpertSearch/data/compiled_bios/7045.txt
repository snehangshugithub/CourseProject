Dynamic microtubules also position the nucleus and the mitotic spindle during cell division.We use a number of high-resolution microscopic techniques, fluorescently tagged proteins and genome edited mammalian cells to answer the following questions:How do microtubules and microtubule motors use the energy of GTP and ATP to organize cellular contents?How are dynamic microtubules spatially organized and regulated within the cell and within the mitotic spindle?How do microtubules and motors contribute to the accuracy of chromosome segregation and to long-term chromosome instability in living cells?What therapies can we develop by exploiting our under-standing of cell division and the cytoskeleton to treat disease.Department of Physiology & Biophysics 2016 University of Washington | Seattle, WAImage: Seattle from Kerry Park
