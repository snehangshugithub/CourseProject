My first job involved research and teaching in the philosophy of science. However a shift in interest to ancient philosophy, the history of skepticism, and Wittgenstein on the normativity of practice sent me off to other shores. I arrived at Berkeley after affiliations at numerous institutions in the United States and abroad (including Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, the Australian National University, and the Humboldt-Universitt zu Berlin). At Berkeley I have offered courses on topics in aesthetics, theory of art, literature, and post-Kantian philosophy concentrating on Early German Idealism, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Heidegger. I continue to maintain close connections to philosophers in Europe; in 2010-11 I pursued research in Germany at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitt (Munich) and at the Humboldt-Universitt zu Berlin (Topoi), and I was again in Berlin in 2016-17 (renewing my affiliation there with the Topoi Institute of the Humboldt-Universitt). My current research focus is a critical theory of Mitsein (Being-with-one-another); the leading question here concerns the role of the Other and the Foreign in creating meaningful communality, as well as the implications of these ideas for questions about the function of art and its relation to language. Other interests of mine include the sublime and the theory of the avant-garde.
