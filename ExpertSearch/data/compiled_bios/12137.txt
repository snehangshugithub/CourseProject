His research expertise lies in the area of membrane science and technology, with a specialization in membrane formation and characterization, transport studies, module design and process development. Professor Fengs current research projects include: the development of hollow fiber membranes and membrane modules; synthesis, modification and characterization of asymmetric/composite membranes; nano-structured membranes for olefin/paraffin separations; and pervaporation, gas separation, and membrane distillation. He is also working on membrane-modulated absorbers and spargers; synergetic integration of membranes with traditional separation processes; carbon dioxide separation for greenhouse gas emission control; separation of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from gaseous and liquid waste streams; and membranes for bio-separations. In addition to research publications, Professor Feng holds a number of patents, some of which are being exploited for industrial applications. He currently also serves on the editorial boards of Journal of Membrane Science, Separation & Purification Technology, and Chemical Engineering Research & Design.Research Interestsmembranes for bio-separationsSeparation Processeshollow fiberadsorptionPolymer ScienceMembrane ReactorsMembrane DistillationCO2 Separation for Greenhouse Gas Emission ControlSeparation of Volatile Organic Compounds from gaseous and liquid waste streamsDevelopment of Hollow Fiber Membranes and Membrane ModulesSynthesis modification and characterization of asymmetric/composite membranesNano-structured membranes for olefin/paraffin separationsPervaporation gas separation and membrane distillationMembrane reactorsMembrane-modulated absorbers adsorbers and spargersSynergetic integration of membranes with traditional separation processeswaterEducation1995, Doctorate, Chemical Engineering, University of Waterloo1990, Master's, Chemical Engineering, University of Ottawa1987, Master's, Industrial Chemistry, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics1984, Bachelor's, Chemical Engineeirng, Hebei University of Science and TechnologyCourses*CHE 230 - Physical Chemistry 1Taught in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019CHE 231 - Physical Chemistry 2Taught in 2016, 2021CHE 330 - Chemical Eng ThermodynamicsTaught in 2020CHE 710 - Spec Tpcs: Transport PhenomenaTaught in 2017, 2020* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsJ.R.
