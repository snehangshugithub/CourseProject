Request changes Biography Dr. Tao is an associate professor in heat stress physiology and management at the University of Georgia in Tifton. Dr. Tao originally is from Kaifeng, China. He obtained his BS (2004) and MS (2007) degrees from Henan University of Technology in China and his Ph.D. at the University of Florida in 2012. After a 2 year postdoc at the same institution, Dr. Tao joined the University of Georgia Tifton campus in 2014 as an assistant professor. B.S. (Agriculture) Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China M.S. (Animal Sciences) Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China Ph.D. (Animal Molecular and Cellular Biology) University of Florida, Gainesville, FL Description of Research and Extension Interests The primary research interest in Dr. Taos lab is heat stress physiology in dairy cattle. The goals of his research team are to understand how heat stress affects the cow and calf on lactation, growth, metabolism and health by different means, and to explore the management and nutritional strategies to minimize the negative effects of heat stress on cows and calves. The extension program is tied with research and the focus is to utilize different management tools, such as environmental manipulations, heat abatement and nutritional strategies, to enhance the production and health of the cow and calf.
