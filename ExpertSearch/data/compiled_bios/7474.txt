Wriston Professor of Neuroscience and Engineering at Brown University. He is known for translational research in human brain computer interfaces to restore movement for people with paralysis (known as BrainGate, as well as for fundamental research to explain how networks of cortical neurons compute actions from plans. At Brown, he was the founding Chair of the Brown Department of Neuroscience, the founding director of the Brown Institute for Brain Science (now the Carney Institute) and the Department of Veterans Affairs Center of Excellence in Neurorestoration and Neurotechnology. Donoghue was a member of the US B.R.A.I.N. initiatives first NIH Working Group and is a fellow of the National Academy of Medicine, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, as well as several other academies.His awards include the German Zlch Prize (2007), the Roche-Nature Medicine Prize (2010), the Schrdinger Prize (Germany, 2012), and the first Israeli Brain Technology Prize in 2013.

Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview My laboratory investigates how the brain turns thought into voluntary behaviors and how that knowledge can be used to help people with paralysis. We study how networks of neurons in the cerebral cortex represent and compute new information to transform a motor plan into a skilled voluntary movement. With the knowledge we have gained about the basic mechanisms of cortical information processing and we have translated our findings into a clinical application called "BrainGate". Using BrainGate technology we have shown that humans with longstanding paralysis can use volitionally generated neural activity to directly control computers to communicate, as well as robotic arms, and their own arms to eat and drink. We hope that our research to understand now the brain computes and our technology development will lead to neurotechnology that will restore natural movement to people with paralysis from stroke, spinal cord injury or neurodegenerative disorders. Research Statement Donoghue's laboratory builds on pioneering research in neurotechnology. Brown, which has established a team of internationally recognized scientists and engineers in this emerging field, seeks to develop brain machine interfaces that can restore independence to paralyzed humans and potentially augment human capabilities. Spinal cord injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and related nervous system diseases are disabling disorders of movement that currently affect millions of people in the United States. Donoghue's lab investigates how the brain turns thought into voluntary behaviors. At the core of this problem is understanding higher level neural coding or how populations of neurons represent complex information. To study neural coding, scientists in the lab are developing novel multielectrode recording arrays suitable for chronic implantation in the cerebral cortex. The lab is using these multielectrode arrays to examine the coding of goal-directed reaching by ensembles of cerebral cortical neurons and to examine how ensembles change when a new motor skill is learned. The laboratory works closely with several other Brown Brain Science faculty members to develop and test theories of higher order representation and to generate new mathematical tools to examine neural codes. Brain Science faculty also are applying the laboratory's knowledge of neural codes for movement to build brain computer interfaces. These devices can potentially be used as a neural prosthetic to restore movement to paralyzed humans. Along with a synergy of talent from the departments of Neuroscience, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and the Medical School, Donoghue's laboratory recently demonstrated the neurotechnology of these devices in landmark proof of concept experiments (Nature 2002). Using this innovative technology, nonhuman primates (monkeys) were able to play videogames directly through brain outputs. The signals are retrieved by unique microelectronic circuitry, and decoded by advanced mathematical and computational techniques. Technologies enable neural signals from a normal brain to bypass injured or diseased spinal cord, nerves, or muscle to provide a new output that can control artificial limbs, robotic equipment, or even the patient's own muscles. The devices can potentially be applied to remote control of computer interfaces or semiautonomous air or sea craft. With colleagues, Donoghue formed a new company (Cyberkinetics, Inc.) that will use tiny arrays of electrodes to capture the information encoded in the firing patterns of populations of neurons to control a computer and thence any device that can be computer controlled.
