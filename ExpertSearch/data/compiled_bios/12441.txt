Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley B.S. Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley Research Interests Andy Dong studies strategy in the design of engineered products and systems. Biography Andy Dong is head of the Oregon State University School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering anda professor of mechanical engineering. His research addresses strategy in the design and innovation of engineered products and systems. His research aims to explain the impact of design strategy on productivity and the betterment potential of new products. His background in artificial intelligence in design has led him to collaborative work across a wide range of topics in behavioral economics, cognition, and computational fabrication. Considered around the world as an expert in design strategy, he has provided advice to major international telecommunications, financial services, and civil aviation companies. He was awarded an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship in 2010, one of the most prestigious research fellowships in Australia, and appointed the inaugural Warren Centre Chair for Engineering Innovation at the University of Sydney in 2012. Prior to joining Oregon State, he was the professor and chair of the MBA in Design Strategy program at California College of the Arts and an adjunct professor of mechanical engineering at theUniversity of California,Berkeley. He is an associate editor for the journal Design Studies. He received his bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degreesin Mechanical Engineering from UC Berkeley.
