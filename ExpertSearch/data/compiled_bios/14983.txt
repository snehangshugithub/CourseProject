Woodland Hastings Endowed Chair in Biochemistry Professor of Chemistry Professor of Bioengineering Professor of Biophysics and Quantitative Biology Director of NIH Biotechnology Center for Macromolecular Modeling and Bioinformatics Full-time Faculty at Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology Research Topics Computational Biology, Drug Discovery, Ion Channels, Membrane Biology, Protein Dynamics, Protein Structure Education B.S. 1989 Tehran University Ph.D. 2001 University of Heidelberg Postdoc. 2000-2003 Univ. of Illinois, U-C Computational Investigation of Biomolecular Systems and Processes at Microscopic Level My research focuses on structure function relationship of biomolecular processes, in particular biological membranes and membrane proteins, and understanding the mechanism of their function using simulation and computational methodologies. Recent advances in structural determination of membrane proteins have resulted in high resolution structures of a large number of biological systems that we can use in simulation studies to understand how the architecture of the protein, and specific interactions and dynamics of its building blocks provide the basis for its molecular mechanism. My group is involved in development of computational methodologies and their application to diverse biomolecular systems in close collaboration with leading experimental groups. Awards 2003: Animation displaying my simulations on aquaporin water channels deposited at the Nobel Museum web site, in conjunction with the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/2003/animations.html 2004: Winner of the 2004 Science and Engineering Visualization Challenge organized by the Science magazine and NSF and published in Science 305, 1905. 2010: Recognized as exceptional by the campus committee on tenure and promotion in terms of the quality of work and achievement, and selected as one of the two top assistant to associate tenure packages of the year in the entire UIUC campus. 2015-2018: University Scholar at University of Illinois 2016: Faculty Excellence Award, School of Molecular and Cellular Biology 2016-present: Endowed Chair Professor of Biochemistry Representative Publications Recent Publications S.
