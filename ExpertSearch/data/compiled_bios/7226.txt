Cao, Physical Mechanisms in Hybrid Additive Manufacturing: A Process Design Framework, Journal of Materials Processing Tech., Volume 291, May 2021, 117048In the Classroom Professor Ehmann teaches courses in the areas of design and manufacturing: Introduction to Design and Manufacturing and one or more of the courses in the Computer Integrated Manufacturing sequence, i.e., Manufacturing Processes, CAD/CAM, and Manufacturing Automation. All these courses heavily rely on regular hands-on laboratory exercises with state-of-the-art software and industrial quality equipment that go well beyond typical laboratory experiences. Professor Ehmann also teaches courses at the graduate level. These include: (a) Computer Control in Manufacturing, which emphasizes the use of digital and adaptive control methods for process and motion control in a variety of machine tools and robots; (b) Metal Cutting, in which the mechanics of material removal processes, their stability, and pragmatic implementation are studied; and (c) Micro-manufacturing, which focuses on the emerging field of miniaturization technologies through the consideration of the associated design, processing, and metrology issues. Prof. Ehmann has supervised over 50 MS and nearly 60 Ph.D. students.
