Advanced Computer Graphics Algorithms and Techniques, MoWe 1:00PM - 2:29PM, Soda 320 Biography James F. OBrien is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley and Chief Scientist at Avametric. His research interests include graphics, computer animation, simulations of physical systems, and the forensic analysis of images and video. He has authored numerous papers on these topics. In addition to his research pursuits, Prof. O'Brien has worked with film and game companies on integrating advanced simulation physics into games and special effects. His methods for destruction modeling have been used in over 100 feature films and AAA game titles. In 2015 the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized his work in destruction modeling with an Academy Award for Technical Achievement. He received his doctorate from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2000, the same year he joined the faculty at UC Berkeley. Professor O'Brien is a Sloan Fellow and ACM Distinguished Scientist, has been selected as one of Technology Review's TR-100, and has been awarded research fellowships from the Okawa and Hellman Foundations. He is currently serving as ACM SIGGRAPH Director at Large.http://obrien.berkeley.edu Education 2000, Ph.D., Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology 1997, M.S., Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology 1992, B.S., Computer Science, Florida International University Selected Publications E.
