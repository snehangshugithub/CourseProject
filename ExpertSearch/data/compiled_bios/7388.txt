M.S. (Mag.), Mathematics, University of Graz, Austria, 2001. M.S. (Mag.), Mathematics and Geometry Education, Graz University of Technology and University of Graz, Austria, 2001. Research Interests My research focuses on the development of efficient methods and algorithms for the numerical solution of large-scale application problems governed by partial differential equations (PDE). I'm particularly interested in deterministic and probabilistic methods for inverse problems, PDE-constrained optimization, numerical methods for variational inequalities, and in parallel scientific computing. Most of my research is driven by problems in computational earth science, e.g., mantle flow and plate tectonics, seismic wave propagation, subsurface flow and the dynamics of polar ice sheets.
