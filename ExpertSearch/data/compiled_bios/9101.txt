His research interests are in piano design, organology, physical systems, animal growth modelling, and environmental systems. Professor Birkett has now completed the bulk of his research in early iron and is in the process of starting to draw wire for pianos. He has been working with high-speed imaging of various fortepiano actions. The P-wire has been thoroughly researched, developed and tested over the past decade by Professor Birkett, and is about to enter commercial production. It is drawn in the proportional Nuremburg sizes and has been reported to have the added advantage of natural corrosion resistance.Research InterestsPiano designorganologyphysical systemsanimal growth modellingenvironmental systemsComputer Simulation of SystemsModeling & SimulationEducation1990, Doctorate, PhD, University of Waterloo1986, Master's, MASc, University of Waterloo1976, Bachelor's, BSc, University of London,King's CollegeCourses*SYDE 114 - Numerical and Applied CalcTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021SYDE 302 - SeminarTaught in 2020SYDE 312 - Applied Linear AlgebraTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021SYDE 351 - Systems Models 1Taught in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsMasoudi, Ramin and Birkett, Stephen, Experimental validation of a mechanistic multibody model of a vertical piano action, Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics, 10(6), 2015Birkett, Stephen, The slippery path from piano key to string, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 136(4), 2014, 2132 - 2132Masoudi, Ramin and Birkett, Stephen and McPhee, John, A Mechanistic Multibody Model for Simulating the Dynamics of a Vertical Piano Action, Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics, 9(3), 2014Birkett, Stephen, Experimental investigation of the piano hammer-string interaction, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 133(4), 2013, 2467 - 2478Borland, Matt and Birkett, Stephen, The implementation of pyschoacoustical signal parameters in the wavelet domain, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 132(3), 2012, 1886 - 1886Graduate StudiesCurrently considering applications from graduate students.
