Her course work has included marketing, marketing research, marketing strategy, brand management, advertising and promotion, new product development, business marketing and operations. Her professional career spans both business to business and consumer product marketing, working for both small and large companies in the manufacturing sector. The pinnacle of her career was spent at Philip Morris USA as a brand manager, where she managed brands contributing over $1 billion in annual sales. Professor Abbruscato was renowned at Philip Morris for developing unprecedented marketing segmentation and promotional programs, and advertising campaigns, achieving superior levels of success, despite the environment of a declining industry.

During her time here at Stony Brook, Professor Abbruscato has pioneered the Target and GEICO Corporation Case Study Program. Although initiated as a "real world" project for her Marketing Strategy students, the case study program has been such a success that the Target Corporation and GEICO have decided to use Stony Brook University as a model for the program's continued success at other colleges and universities. Professor Abbruscato is also the founder and faculty advisor of the Universitys American Marketing Association student chapter of which she has developed a variety of student career and fundraising entities including a student run marketing agency, a corporate sponsorship program, a professional networking panel, and a community service/charitable giving program.
