His work includes developing computational and experimental human-centered design theory and methodology, specifically digital human modeling and human-in-the-loopdesign to incorporate human factorsengineering principles early in the design for automotive, aviation, consumer, and healthcare product development. Biography Onan Demirel is an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Oregon State University. He received his Ph.D., MS, and BS degrees from Purdue University. His research focuses on understanding human element in the design process, making advances in Digital Human Modeling (DHM) theory and practice, and developing multi-disciplinary design theory and methods to explore inter-dependencies and co-evolution of the human element in engineering systems. Dr. Demirels work engages in human subject data collection and virtual simulations and applies mechanical engineering design methods with industrial design techniques to include human needs, abilities, and limitations early in the design process. He has been at Oregon State since 2016. Selected Publications: Soria Zurita, N. F., Stone, R. B., Onan Demirel, H., & Tumer, I. Y. (2020).
