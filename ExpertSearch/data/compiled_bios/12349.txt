Chisholm Institute Professor Sallie (Penny) W. Chisholm studies the biology, ecology, and evolution of the single most abundant marine phytoplankton species in order to understand the forces that shape microbial ecosystems. 617-253-1771 Phone 48-419 Office chisholm@mit.edu Email Lab Website Tyler Sousa Assistant 617-258-8993 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1974, SUNY Albany Research Summary Our goal is to understand the ecology and evolution of ocean microbes and how they influence global biogeochemical cycles. We focus on the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, which is the smallest and most abundant microbe in ocean ecosystems sometimes accounting for half the total photosynthetic biomass. We use this model system to study life across all scales from the genome to the ecosystem.
