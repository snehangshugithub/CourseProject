By using biofabrication strategies, the research group designs bio-inspired materials that work at the biotic/abiotic interface toprevent or mitigate environmental impact. His interests and collaborative opportunities span widely across the department. He brings a wealth of experience, and a strong focus onengineering and innovation from a multiple-scale perspective with interests that include mechanical and optoelectronic properties of natural polymers, biocomposites, additive manufacturing, and emerging technologies.Subscribe to our newsletter Email* CommentsThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
