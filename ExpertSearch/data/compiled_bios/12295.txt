Afterward he was appointed Adjunct Assistant Professor at Providence College (Rhode Island, USA) where he teaches applied mathematics, today in the capacity of Associate Professor. Dr Shomberg is interested in the global well-posedness and the existence of attractors for dissipative dynamical systems arising from mathematical physics. His focus is on dynamic boundary conditions, memory, anomalous diffusion as well as continuity properties of attractors for perturbed systems. Area(s) of Expertise: Partial differential equations and infinite dimensional dynamical systems Teaching Philosophy: "Die ganzen Zahlen hat der liebe Gott gemacht, alles andere ist Menschenwerk" -Leopold Kronecker Detailed CVPersonal website Mathematics & Computer Science FacultyLynette BoosLiam DonohoeFrank FordVani GuptaJeffrey HoagWataru IshizukaSu-Jeong KangMary KarkerFr.
