Her specialty is providing evidenced-based interventions within the school setting to meet the communication, social and academic challenges that these children face. Welty teaches Research in Speech-Language Pathology for the M.S. in Speech Language Pathology and teaches Research in Communication Disorders and Speech and Language Development and Disorders within the undergraduate program. She utilizes case studies, current readings and discussions to encourage the development of critical thinking within her students, with an emphasis on clinical application of theoretical principles. When teaching research she focuses on writing as a process and equips students to present their research at state and national conferences in speech-language pathology. Welty counts it a privilege to engage students in prayer and reflection on the Word of God, which will equip them to grow as competent and compassionate professionals. She also encourages students to integrate scriptural principles as they analyze evidence and evaluate solutions to clinical and theoretical problems. Weltys dissertation was entitled California Special Education Eligibility: Analysis of Trends from 2002-2010. She is interested in the scholarship of teaching and learning, specifically evaluating classroom pedagogy and instructional techniques when teaching research writing.AwardsASHA Continuing Education Award, January, 2016 ASHA Continuing Education Award, January, 2012Accepted into the Alpha Chi National College Honor Society May, 2012Publications (Selected)Welty, S.
