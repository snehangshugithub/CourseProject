She studies the structures of complex crystalline materials and their formation, aiming to understand the rules that govern their assembly and stability and to ultimately be able to predict and design new materials.Dshemuchadse earned an undergraduate physics degree at TU Dresden in Germany, where she started working with X-ray diffraction to analyze the structures of inorganic compounds. Dshemuchadse then moved to Switzerland for her PhD in Materials Science at ETH Zurich, where she investigated building principles of complex intermetallic compounds under the guidance of Walter Steurer.In 2015, Dshemuchadse joined the group of Sharon Glotzer at the University of Michigan as a postdoc, where she started working with molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations to study soft-matter self-assembly.Dshemuchadse now combines her background in crystallography with the modeling and discovery of materials via numerical simulations.Her group studies the self-assembly and stability of complex crystal structures.Besides analyzing structures and determining symmetries, Dshemuchadse loves to read and travel, and enjoys exploring the outdoorsbiking, hiking, and camping.Research InterestsAdvanced MaterialsColloids and Interfacial SciencePolymers and Soft MatterResearch Group MembersSelected PublicationsA.
