His doctoral work focused on understanding how noncovalent interactions can be used to design new self-assembled materials. The bulk of his thesis focused on the investigation of the structure-property relationships of complex coacervate crosslinked hydrogels for use as injectable drug delivery hydrogels. In 2013, he received a National Research Council Research Associateship to do his postdoctoral research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the Biomaterials group. At NIST, he studied how polyelectrolytes can be used as noncollagenous protein mimics in controlling calcium phosphate nanoparticle formation in early bone growth. In 2014, he joined the Applied Research Institute at the University of Illinois and in 2017 he also received an appointment as a Research Assistant Professor in Materials Science and Engineering. His research focuses on the processing-structure-property relationships of soft material systems including block copolymers, biomaterials and coatings. Research Statement Our research can be broadly categorized as use-inspired fundamental research on a wide variety of soft material systems. Our group looks to extend our understanding from the structure-property relationships of soft material components (such as polymers, biopolymers and organic small molecules) to include the effects of processing on the performance of soft materials systems. The three main thrusts of our research include: scalable self-assembly, biomaterials and polymeric coatings. Briefly, in the scalable self-assembly thrust, we are interested in understanding how we can use processing to develop self-assembled nanostructures at scales that are industrially relevant. In the biomaterials thrust, our projects have focused on the development of novel biomaterials as well as on the manufacturing and packaging of biomaterials. Lastly, in the polymeric coatings thrust, our research combines state-of-the-art nanoscale characterization with industrially relevant processing and testing methods in order to understand the mechanisms of coating production, performance and degradation.
