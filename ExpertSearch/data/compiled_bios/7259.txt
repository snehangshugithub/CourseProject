Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL B.S. Mechanical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MAResearch InterestsI am interested in the development and application of computational simulations methods for multi-scale and multi-physics problems in engineering, especially in the areas of fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and material transport. Many of the most fascinating engineering systems are characterized by two or more physical phenomena coupled together in a single domain or across an interface. My research is focused on the development of models for these of these types of problems, and their solution using high performance computing tools. Examples include melting and solidification of metal in advanced manufacturing processes, fluid-structure interaction in the human heart and vascular system, heat transfer in multi-phase flows, and multi-scale transport in environmental systems.Selected PublicationsGan, Zhengtao; Lian, Yanping; Lin, Stephen E.; Jones, Kevontrez K.; Liu, Wing Kam; Wagner, Gregory J., Benchmark Study of Thermal Behavior, Surface Topography, and Dendritic Microstructure in Selective Laser Melting of Inconel 625, Integrating Materials and Manufacturing Innovation 8(2):178-193.Lin, Stephen; Yan, Jinhui; Kats, Dmitriy; Wagner, Gregory J., A volume-conserving balanced-force level set method on unstructured meshes using a control volume finite element formulation, Journal of Computational Physics 380:119-142.Lian, Yanping; Gan, Zhengtao; Yu, Cheng; Kats, Dmitriy; Liu, Wing Kam; Wagner, Gregory J., A cellular automaton finite volume method for microstructure evolution during additive manufacturing, Materials and Design 169.Yan, J.; Lin, S.; Bazilevs, Y.; Wagner, Gregory J, Isogeometric analysis of multi-phase flows with surface tension and with application to dynamics of rising bubbles, Computers and Fluids 179:777-789.Lian, Yanping; Lin, Stephen; Yan, Wentao; Liu, Wing Kam; Wagner, Gregory J., A parallelized three-dimensional cellular automaton model for grain growth during additive manufacturing, Computational Mechanics 61(5):543-558.Yan, Wentao; Lin, Stephen; Kafka, Orion L.; Yu, Cheng; Liu, Zeliang; Lian, Yanping; Wolff, Sarah; Cao, Jian; Wagner, Gregory J.; Liu, Wing Kam, Modeling process-structure-property relationships for additive manufacturing, Frontiers of Mechanical Engineering 13(4):482-492.Lian, Y.
