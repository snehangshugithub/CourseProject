While most of my research has been theoretical in nature, I have also carried out telescopic observations of dynamical phenomena in sunspots and the solar atmosphere, at the National Solar Observatory in New Mexico. Some of my research involved collaborations with colleagues in Rochesters Department of Physics and Astronomy and at the University of Cambridge in England, LAEFF in Madrid, the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder, and elsewhere. Recently my interests have turned to fluid dynamics of the brains glymphatic system. Specific topics of my research include:Sunspot Structure and DynamicsTheoretical models of intense magnetic flux tubes on the Sun. Calculations of siphon flows along magnetic flux tubes, including the effects of radiative transfer and variable ionization and the behavior of shock waves in supercritical flows. Theory and observation of the structure and dynamics of sunspots, especially the filamentary structure and Evershed flow in the penumbra. Numerical simulations of magnetic flux pumping in the photosphere around a sunspot.Sunspot SeismologyTheory and observations of the interaction of a sunspot with the resonant acoustic modes of the Sun, as a means of probing the subsurface structure of a sunspot. The theoretical work involves the study of waves in a stratified, compressible, magnetized atmosphere.Solar and Stellar DynamosDynamo generation of magnetic fields in the Sun and other stars. Nonlinear and chaotic stellar dynamos.Fluid Dynamics of the Brains Glymphatic SystemThe glymphatic system is a pathway for movement of cerebrospinal fluid through the brain that serves to remove metabolic waste products, including those proteins whose accumulation is associated with Alzheimers and other diseases. I am part of a team of researchers in Mechanical Engineering and the Medical School carrying out experimental and theoretical studies of fluid flow in this system, with support from NIH and the Army Research Office.Representative PublicationsSunspots: Theory and Observations, ed.
