Austin, Austin, TX B.S. Chemical Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, ILResearch InterestsMy group is interested in controlling the movement of materials across biological membranes, with a goal of enabling and enhancing the production of pharmaceuticals, biofuels, and materials in microbes. Manipulating the transport of electrons, small molecules, and even signals across these cellular boundaries is a vital component of most synthetic biology applications, and we are developing the tools and methods to engineer membrane proteins and other protein superstructures to meet this grand challenge.Selected PublicationsGlasgow J.E., Asensio M.A., Jakobson C.M., Francis M.B., Tullman-Ercek D.
