He has introduced a new class of dynamical systems with active singularities that admit control actions during the singular phases of their motion.He is currently developing a modeling and controller synthesis framework for a new class of dynamical systems he introduced. These systems, which have active singularities that admit control actions during the singular phases of their motion, constitute a new class of hybrid systems characterized by impulsively controlled discrete transitions.
