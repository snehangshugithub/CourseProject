With twenty years of experience in higher ed, the breadth and depth of Bryans knowledge on matters related to diversity, equity, and inclusion is truly impressive. He has a proven track record of facilitating positive change at the institutions where he has worked, including The Ohio State University, Johns Hopkins University, and Cornell University to name a few. Bryan is also familiar with MIT, having formerly worked as MITs Director of Minority Recruitment, where he created, implemented, and managed a first-year recruitment plan leading to a 46% increase in URM enrolled students. Throughout his career, Bryan has had outstanding results with the creation of admission policies that led to the identification, recruitment, admission, enrollment, and graduation of diverse and low-income students. He also has collaborated with many stakeholders to promote strong and healthy communities at the institutions where he has worked. In addition to a diverse range of experiences in higher ed, Bryan brings tremendous energy, compassion, and a great sense of humor. Bryan will play an important role in fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment within our department. He will work closely with departmental leadership and the MechE DEI Task Force to apply his knowledge of best practices to the department in various relevant contexts.
