We3 Lab Projects Rajagopal Lab The Powernet and Sustainable Systems Lab Powernet is an end-to-end, open-source system that will enable real-time coordination of utilities centralized, large assets with millions of distributed resources. It integrates embedded sensing and computing, power electronics, data analytics and networking with cloud computing.Powernet Lab The Stanford Sustainable Systems Lab's research is on signal processing, statistics, communication and control of sustainable large complex networks.Sustainable Systems Lab Davis Lab The Davis group works on water and waste, health and development Jenna Davis is a professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, the Higgins-Magid Senior Fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment and director of Stanford's Program on Water, Health and Development. Her group, which is affectionately known as the Poop Group, focuses on the interface of engineered water supply and sanitation systems and their users, largely in developing countries. Davis has conducted field research in more than a dozen countries, including most recently Uganda, Zambia and India. More than 30 graduate students and post-docs have obtained training in the field with Poop Group projects. Davis Group Spormann Lab Alfred M. Spormann Laboratory Research interests in our lab are at the interface of fundamental metabolic processes of anaerobic microorganisms and their application in bioenergy, bioremediation, and human intestinal health. Spormann Lab Boehm Lab Boehm Research Group I am interested in pathogens in the environment including their sources, fate, and transport in natural and engineered systems. I am interested in understanding of how pathogens are transmitted to humans through contact with water, feces, and contaminated surfaces. My research is focused on key problems in both developed and developing countries with the overarching goal of designing and testing novel interventions and technologies for reducing the burden of disease. I am also interested broadly in coastal water quality where my work addresses the sources, transformation, transport, and ecology of biocolloids - specifically fecal indicator organisms, DNA, pathogens, and phytoplankton - as well as sources and fate of nitrogen. This knowledge is crucial to formulating new management policies and engineering practices that protect human and ecosystem health at the coastal margins.

Water Resources Management for an Uncertain Future The Fletcher Lab Using engineering tools and policy analysis to create a more sustainable and just world We work to advance water resources management to promote resilient and equitable responses to an uncertain future. We develop computational modeling approaches that bridge the natural and social environments. Our approach improves understanding of the water and climate risks that threaten people and the environment, while developing systems-based engineering and policy solutions.

Mitch Lab Website Baker Research Group Professor Baker's work focuses on the development and use ofprobabilistic and statistical tools for managing risk due to extreme loads on the built environment. He studies risk to spatially distributed systems, characterization of earthquake ground motions, and probabilistic risk assessments for a number of types of structures. Professor Baker joined Stanford in 2006 from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), where he was a visiting researcher in the Department of Structural Engineering. He has degrees in Structural Engineering (Stanford, M.S. 2002, Ph.D. 2005), Statistics (Stanford, M.S. 2004) and Mathematics/Physics (Whitman College, B.A. 2000). His awards include the Shah Family Innovation Prize from the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, the CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation, the Early Achievement Research Award from the International Association for Structural Safety and Reliability, the Walter L. Huber Prize from ASCE, the Helmut Krawinkler Award from the Structural Engineers Association of Northern California, and the Eugene L. Grant Award for excellence in teaching from Stanford. The Baker Lab Building for Wellbeing The Billington Lab Our group studies the impact of building design, materials, and symbols on human wellbeing including stress, physical activity, creativity, sense of belonging, and pro-environmental behavior. We are exploring how buildings can include both physical and digital adaptations to improve wellbeing outcomes including new methods of bringing nature and the experience of nature into buildings. We are interested in how building management systems can be extended beyond providing energy savings, thermal comfort, and security to support and maintain a broader set of human wellbeing outcomes while preserving occupant privacy. Further, we are studying the impact of built features, including historic structures, on community wellbeing and methods of design for community wellbeing that support the equitable development of affordable and permanent supportive housing. The Billington Lab Fringer Research Group y research group focuses on the development and implementation of numerical modeling techniques to simulate multiscale fluid dynamical processes in the environment. While the ultimate goal is to develop accurate numerical modeling tools to simulate surface water flows and predict environmental impacts, the research is also driven by the need to understand basic physical processes. To address these needs, we work on computational and numerical analysis to develop numerical models. We use these models to study the fluid dynamics of surface water flows, focusing on problems spanning a wide range of space and time scales. Fringer Research Group Gorle Lab Wind Engineering Lab Wind Engineering for Sustainable Urban Environments We aim to advance understanding and predictive modeling of wind flow in urban areas through collaborative learning and research.Our research focusses on establishing multi-scale and multi-fidelity modeling frameworks that incorporate uncertainty quantification and data assimilation, and oninvestigating how these tools can effectively support sustainable urban and building design. https://we.stanford.edu/ Jain Lab STANFORD URBAN INFORMATICS LAB We develop socio-technical and data-driven solutions to sustainability challenges facing the urban built environment Urban Informatics Lab Website Ouellette Lab Environmental Complexity Laboratory Systems governed by nonlinear equations of motion behave in ways that are qualitatively different from their linear counterparts. Nonlinearities lead to complex response to perturbations: energy, momentum, and other physical quantities can be redistributed among many different length and time scales, and the system can display chaos. But even though the behavior of such systems, such as turbulent fluid flow, can be extremely complicated, it is not random. Rather, nonlinear systems often show a high degree of spontaneous self-organization, with coherent macroscopic behavior emerging from the complex small-scale dynamics. In the Environmental Complexity Lab, we study self-organization in a variety of complex systems with relevance to the environment, ranging from turbulent fluid flow to granular materials to collective motion in animal groups. In all cases, we aim to characterize the macroscopic behavior, understand its origin in the microscopic dynamics, and ultimately harness it for engineering applications. Most of our projects are experimental, though we also use numerical simulation and mathematical modeling when appropriate. We specialize in high-speed, detailed imaging and statistical analysis.

Environmental Complexity Lab Website Luthy Group My group works on environmental engineering and water quality with an emphasis on both engineered physicochemical processes and natural treatment processes. We seek to apply this knowledge to sustainable, systems-level solutions for water reuse and water quality management. Broadly, this work addresses the Re-invention of the Nations Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt, renuwit.org). The research also includes efficient management of contaminants in sediments in bays and lakes. Our research studies the fate of organic compounds and interdisciplinary approaches to understand the behavior and bioavailability of organic contaminants with application to water quality criteria and new management practices, and the implications for efficient water reuse and ecological benefits.
