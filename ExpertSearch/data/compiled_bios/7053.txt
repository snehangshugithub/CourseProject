We study natural populations, and we conduct fieldwork to collect specimens for our research. Most of us study amphibians and reptiles, but we also have on-going projects focused on birds andmammals. We maintain an active research lab with a mix of graduate students, undergraduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in the Department of Biology and at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture. We use a wide variety of new genomic tools in our research, including SNPs for phylogeography and species delimitation and targeted sequence capture for phylogenomics. We are also interested in phylogenetic methods, and we conduct computer simulations to study statistical aspects of species tree inference and species delimitation. Adam started at the University of Washington in 2010 as anAssistant Professor in theDepartment of Biologyand Curator of Genetic Resources & Herpetology at theBurke Museum. Hes also a member of theStatistical Genetics Faculty Core.
