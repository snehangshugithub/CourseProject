We study bioelectrochemical systems and ion exchange membrane applications for energy-efficient recovery of nutrients from wastewater (e.g., source separated human urine, dewatering centrate). We also research bioelectrochemical systems for efficient separation of toxic heavy metals (e.g., cadmium, lead, chromium) from wastewater. Anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge is another key area in my research program. To improve biogas production and sludge stabilization, we look into kinetics of various biological reactions in thermophilic pretreatment of wastewater sludge. We are also developing new numerical models and sludge characterization methods for reliable prediction in wastewater sludge treatment. My group also researches fundamentals of bioelectrochemical systems or microbial electrochemistry cells, such as (1) Electron transfer models; (2) Kinetic constant estimation; and (3) Bioanode sensors. We are currently developing reliable enzyme kinetic models to understand electric current generation by exoelectrogenic bacteria. We also work on estimating kinetic constants for the growth and decay of exoelectrogenic bacteria in microbial electrochemistry cells. Bioanode sensors are an emerging technology as a water quality monitoring tool because bioanodes can create measurable electric signals by exoelectrogenic bacteria and the bacteria are sensitive to various water quality parameters, such as readily biodegradable organics, heavy metals, and nutrients. We are focusing on eliminating and controlling the hysteresis effect which is known to be one of the main challenges for accurate bioanode sensor applications. Education B.E., M.S.
