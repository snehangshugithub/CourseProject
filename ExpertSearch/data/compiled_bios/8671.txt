Oliver Gao Howard Simpson Professor Civil and Environmental Engineering 314 Hollister Hall 607/254-8334 Director of Systems Engineering Associate Director of the Cornell Program in Infrastructure Policy hg55@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyDr. Gao is the Director of the Cornell Systems Engineering Program and Howard Simpson Professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University.Gao is an international leading expert in urban infrastructure, transportation, and environment systems analytics/modeling and innovation for healthy living in smart communities. His research focuses on urban technology, data science, integrated computational engineering models, and trans-disciplinary systems solutions for intelligent urban systems, low carbon and low emission transportation, and human-centered urban design for environment and public health. He is an elected member in the graduate fields of 1) Civil and Environmental Engineering, 2) Computer Science and Engineering; 3) Air Quality in Earth and Atmospheric Science, and 4) Systems Engineering at Cornell University. As the funding director, Gao spearheads cross-disciplinary systems research at the Center for Transportation, Environment, and Community Health (CTECH). Leveraging behavioral and economic sciences, epidemiology, information technology, and environmental and transportation sciences and technologies,Gao leads CTECH with a vision for systems innovations in research, teaching, and workforce development through diversity that support sustainable mobility of people and goods while preserving the environment and improving community health. The Cornell University Post-Processing Software (CU-PPS) for air quality and congestion management developed by Gaos group is the nations first web-based software integrating activity-based travel demand models with EPA MOVES model. It is the official software in use for New York City to ensure that transportation plans and programs will not cause any new violations of federal air quality standards, hence protecting a population of 12.4 million in NYC metro area. In 2014-2018, he served as the Editor-in-Chief of Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment.Before joining Cornell, Gao was a QUANT in the mathematical and econometrical modeling division at the Rohatyn Group, LLG, a Wall Street hedge fund specializing in emerging markets including the BRIC countries.Research InterestsGao's research interests include urban technology, data science, networks/complex systems, engineering computing, statistics/econometrics, and mathematical optimization & operations research forUrbanInfrastructure/Technology Systems, Healthy Community, and Smart Cities.Cooperative networked built-and-natural environment:Computational infrastructure and environment system sustainability management and optimization for the protection of human health and natural systems; inter-relationship between infrastructure and air quality, multi-scale air quality modeling linking health risks modeling to air quality, infrastructure investment, and policyUrban Tech innovation and assessment for clean transportation and community health:(hybrid-diesel electrical technology, alternative fuels, diesel retrofit, congestion pricing) measurement, integrated modeling, and systems analytics of environment and health impacts from alternative vehicle/engine/fuel technologies and policy innovationData science,artificial intelligence, and systems analytics for the planning and management of complex systems/networks:integrated infrastructure and environment/energy systems modeling and advanced decision methodologies (e.g., low carbon and low emission transportation systems; complex systems of coupled transportation, environment and energy networks)Cyber-innovation in data-driven high-fidelity urban informatics for healthy living in smart & sustainable cities:air quality and exposure monitoring, cellular microwave networks for air quality and precipitation monitoring, advanced travelers general information systems (ATGIS)Performance-based engineering and life-cycle management of infrastructure and technology systems:mathematical modeling and control theory for life-cycle management optimization of sustainable infrastructure and environment systems--technology, system analytics, and decision scienceGreen supply chain and logistics: low carbon agriculture systems and food supply chains; mathematical systems modeling and policy analyses for food security and carbon policyTransportationComplex Systems, Network Science and ComputationData MiningData ScienceHealth SystemsEnergy SystemsInformation Theory and CommunicationsScientific ComputingSystems and Networking Infrastructure SystemsEnergy and the EnvironmentTransportation Systems EngineeringAlgorithmsTeaching InterestsCEE 4650/6650: Transportation systems and air quality planning and modelingSYSEN 5300/5310: Systems engineering and six sigma for the design and operation of reliable systems (including Distance Learning)SYSEN 5400: Theoryand application of systems architecting (including Distance Learning)SYSEN 5450: Managing and Modeling Complex Systems for Organizational LeadersSYSEN6000: Foundation of Complex SystemsSYSEN6100: Ezra Roundtable Systems Seminar SeriesSelected PublicationsPan, S., L.
