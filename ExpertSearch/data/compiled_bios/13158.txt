Her research seeks to understand the processes that have differentiated the chemistry of Earths solid interior, mostly through laboratory experiments. Prior to joining Cornell, Megan was a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow with appointments at the Smithsonian Institution and Yale University.Research InterestsMegan uses controlled laboratory experiments to develop new geochemical tools to quantify the rates (time) and conditions (temperature, pressure, redox state) of magmatic and metamorphic processes. Areas of interest include crystal clock diffusion chronometry, trace element partitioning in subduction zone settings, and multi-valent element x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy.Geochemistry, Petrology and VolcanologyEarth System ScienceEnergy, Mineral and Water ResourcesSelected PublicationsOsborne Z., Thomas J.B., Nachlas W., Baldwin S., Holycross M.E., Spear F., WatsonE.B.
