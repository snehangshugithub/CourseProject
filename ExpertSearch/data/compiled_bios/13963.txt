Davis, 1992 M.S., Mechanical Engineering/Material Science, U.C. Davis, 1987 B.S., Mechanical Engineering/Material Science, U.C. Davis, 1984 Research Interests Dr. Bays research utilizes image-based metrology methods (Digital Image and Digital Volume Correlation) for the study of complex materials and processes. In addition to fundamental technique development, application areas include biomaterials, orthopedic biomechanics, lithium batteries, wood products, geomaterials, and advanced manufacturing methods. Current materials-focused projects are utilizing Digital Volume Correlation applied to synchrotron x-ray tomography of biological tissues under in situ loading to further the understanding of significant orthopedic clinical problems: osteoarthritis in synovial joints (knees, hips) and injury/degradation of intervertebral discs in the spine. Current process-focused projects are utilizing Digital Image Correlation for the quantitative monitoring of Selective Laser Melting (SLM) Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes in a technique known as Comprehensive Layer Monitoring (CLM) for improvement and documentation of component quality. Dr. Bay has active collaborations with researchers and facilities in the UK (University College London, University of Manchester, Royal Veterinary College, Diamond Light Source, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory) and has received support from the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, the State of Oregon, and a variety of industry partners. Background At OSU since 2000 Assistant Professor, U.C. Davis, 19952000 Member of Scientific Staff, Shriners Hospital, 19962000 Postdoctoral Fellow, U.C. Davis School of Medicine, 19921995 Postgraduate Researcher, U.C. Davis School of Medicine, 19901991 Biography Dr. Bay is an associate professor in the Materials/Mechanics group in the School of Mechanical, Industrial, andManufacturing Engineering at Oregon State University. He received all of his degrees from the University of California, Davis, progressing through programs in materials science, mechanical engineering, and biomedical engineering, with a Ph.D. granted in 1992. He then transitioned to postdoctoral and assistant research faculty positions with the Orthopedic Surgery Department at the School of Medicine at University of California, Davis. Tissue biomechanics experimentation and x-ray microtomography merged within that environment in the form of Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), a methodology first demonstrated by Dr. Bay in a publication that received theHetnyi awardfrom the Society for Experimental Mechanics in 2001. Increasing adoption of DVC within the research community led to granting of the Founders Award from the International Digital Image Correlation Society in 2016, and Dr. Bay now serves on the Board of Directors. Current research is exploring methods of improving volumetric correlation through explicit microstructure linkages, detailed tissue biomechanics studies utilizingin situphase contrast synchrotron x-ray tomography, and advancing the application of image correlation methods in non-traditional areas such as advanced manufacturing, with Selective Laser Melting (SLM) of metal powders a particular interest.
