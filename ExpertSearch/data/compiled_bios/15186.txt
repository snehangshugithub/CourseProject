In particular he has made an important contribution to the conjectured Banks-Fishler-Shenker-Susskind (BFSS) matrix model of string theory and M-theory. String theory is a proposed perturbative theory that would unify all of the fundamental forces of physics; in other words it is a "theory of everything". Its non-perturbative counterpart is a hypothetical theory called M-theory. One part of the BFSS conjecture relates the scattering of bound states to scattering of supergravitons. (Eleven-dimensional supergravity is a known low-energy limit of M-theory.) This relation has been verified in many cases; the strongest results in this direction belong to Professor Waldron [1, 3]. Professor Waldron has also studied other problems arising in M-theory and in supergravity. In particular, he analyzed higher spin fields on a special model universe called anti-de-Sitter space. These results are relevant to the AdS/CFT conjecture in M-theory, which asserts that supergravity on anti-de-Sitter space is equivalent to conformal field theory on its boundary [5]. Several other articles by Professor Waldron are devoted to the theory of spinors and of operators acting on spinor fields. For example, he calculated the index of non-standard Dirac operators [2]. This result in the vein of the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem, which was one of the first connections between quantum field theory and goemetric topology.
