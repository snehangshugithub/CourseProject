Sc., Physics and Mathematics, St. Petersburg Polytechnic Institute, Russia Engineer-Physicist, St. Petersburg Polytechnic Institute, St. Petersburg, RussiaResearch InterestsMy research interests continue to evolve. The earlier papers listed here are concerned with fluid dynamics, polymer physics, Brownian motion, liquid crystals,and stochastic processes. I became interested in geology and geophysics in 2000.My current research is focused on cosmology.Selected PublicationsVanishing vacuum energy, Astroparticle Physics 115, 102387 (2020)The emergence of cosmic repulsion,Astroparticle Physics 62, 258-268 (2015)Boltzmann factor and Hawking radiation, Physics Letters B 734, 394-395 (2014)Abrupt global events in the Earth's history: a physics perspective,Reports on Progress in Physics 73, 122801 (2010)The late David Raup, the world's most brilliant paleontologist, wrote the following about the above paper:Thanks for the manuscript.I find your message thrilling and a bit scary. I sure hope you're right.It would solve a lot of problems with extinction.Right or wrong, you have convinced me that there has to be some sort of rather common (i.e., 1 myr time scale) environmental shock to explain extinction.Secular variation of the Earth's magnetic field: induced by the ocean flow?New Journal of Physics 11, 063015 (2009)Methane-driven oceanic eruptions and mass extinctions,Geology 31, 741 - 744 (2003)Simple procedure for correcting equations of evolution: Application to Markov processes,Phys.
