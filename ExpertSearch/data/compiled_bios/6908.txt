He completed his PhD at Columbia University in New York City where he specialized in biochemistry and molecular biophysics,specifically Cryo-EM techniques for visualizing biomacromolecules. His dissertation work focused on reconstructing 3-D structures of macromolecular complexes in the cell. From these models, one can elucidate crucial protein-protein interactions that advance mechanistic understanding of how such molecular machines work. Outside of Columbia University, Dr. Ho is a Senior Medical Director (SMD) at ahealthcare communications agency. As an SMD, he is a lead scientific and medical consultant on translational research strategy, scientificstorytelling, and medical education innovations. His specialty is in immunologic diseases,particularly those which are autoimmune.
