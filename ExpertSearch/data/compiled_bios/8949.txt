Patel is founding member of the doctoral program in personal health informatics and founder and director of the Communication Analysis and Design Laboratory (CadLab). The CadLab is an interdisciplinary group that conducts fundamental research on speech production and applies empirical findings toward the design and development of novel human-machine communication interfaces. Research projects range from analysis of prosody (a.k.a. speech melody) production across the lifespan in neurotypical speakers and those with neuromotor impairment, to implementing novel multimodal assistive communication interfaces. Students from speech and hearing sciences, electrical engineering and computer science work collaboratively in the CadLab, a state-of-the-art facility for conducting psychoacoustic studies, software design, prototyping and usability testing. VocaliD.ai, is a CadLab spin-out that is a pioneer in the area of customized AI voices for individuals and organizations seeking a differentiated voice experience. Dr. Patel has spoken at TED and her work has been covered by NPR, BBC, The Atlantic, Wired, and more. She is a fellow of the Aspen Global Leadership Network and has been named a Voice Tech visionary.Honors & AwardsVoice Tech Visionary, Voicebot.aiFellow of the Aspen Global Leadership Network Toggle Accordion Research Research OverviewSpeech acoustics, Speech signal processing, AI Voice, voice analyticsCommunication Analysis and Design LabNortheastern Universitys CadLab is an interdisciplinary research group focused on the study of speech communication in typically developing talkers and individuals with neuromotor speech impairments; this basic science knowledge is then applied toward the design of technologies that enable, enrich, and enhance communication.
