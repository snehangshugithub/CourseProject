Whyte Director, Plasma Science and Fusion Center Hitachi America Professor of Engineering whyte@mit.edu 617-253-1748 NW17-288 Assistant: Kristina Souza souzakm@mit.edu Plasma Science & Fusion Center SPARC Plasma Surface Interactions Science Center Bio Dennis Whyte is a recognized leader in the field of fusion research using the magnetic confinement of plasmas for energy production on a faster, smaller, and more innovative path. Dennis is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, has over 300 publications, and is heavily involved as an educator. He is widely recognized for his themes of innovation and the need for speed and economic viability in fusion. He has served on panels for the National Academies, the U.S. government, and the Royal Society. As director of Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC) he presents the Centers vision to peer institutions and recruits faculty and scientists to the team. The core of the SPARC project was formed over eight years ago during a design course led by Dennis to challenge assumptions in fusion. Many of the ideas underpinning the high-field approach including the use of HTS for high-field, demountable magnets, liquid blankets, and ARC have been conceived of or significantly advanced in these courses. Dennis leadership as director of PSFC has been a key enabler for the SPARC project, providing the stature necessary to bring the institutional and outside support to the project. Education Ph.D. U.
