Mechanical Engineering, MIT, Cambridge, MA B.S. Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MIResearch InterestsRichard Lueptow's current research interests are in three areas: 1) Modeling, simulation, and experiments on the segregation and mixing of bi-and poly-disperse granular materials, both spherical and non-spherical, in quasi-2D and fully 3D geometries; 2) A dynamical systems approach to mixing by "cutting and shuffling," particularly as applied to granular materials; 3) Molecular level simulation of transport processes in polymeric nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes.Significant RecognitionAmerican Institute of Chemical Engineers Dow Particle Processing Recognition Award, 2021Northwestern University McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science Teacher of the Year Award (2 times) Society of Automotive Engineers Teetor Educational Award American Society for Engineering Education Dow Outstanding Young Faculty Award William M.
