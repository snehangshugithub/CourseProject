He received his PhD degree (cum laude) in Mechanical Engineering from Politecnico di Milano in 2014. Following his graduate studies, he completed a postdoctoral appointment in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT. Mostafas academic training in Mechanical Engineering focused on solid mechanics and structural materials.Research InterestsMostafa uses experiments, analytical theory, and computer simulations to understand the structure-property relation in structural materials, with particular emphasis on the extreme conditions of plastic strain, deformation rate, pressure, temperature, and energetic particle/photon fluxes. He also exploits such conditions for advanced processing of materials and solid-state additive manufacturing. His current research focuses are constitutive modeling of structural and soft materials, synchrotron x-rays and in-situ studies of deformation and failures, mechanics of impact and indentation, solid-state additive manufacturing and coatings.Advanced MaterialsComputational Solid MechanicsAdvanced Materials ProcessingComputational Solid MechanicsMaterials Synthesis and ProcessingNanotechnologyAdvanced Manufacturing and MaterialsTeaching InterestsExperimental and Applied Mechanics of Structures, Mechanical Properties of Materials, Processing, and Design, Finite Element Analysis for Mechanical and Aerospace Design, Mechanical Properties of Thin Films.Selected PublicationsM.
