His recent work includes pioneeringstudies of topological Weyl, Dirac and nodal linesemimetals, topological insulators and superconductors, and quantum spin liquids. Dr. Burkovs work hasstrong connections to other fields of physics, in particular to elementary particle physics and quantum computing. Contact information Office: PHY 369 Phone: 519 888-4567 ext. 46901 Email: aburkov@uwaterloo.ca Website:https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/aburkov Expertise Strongly correlated many-particle physics Spintronics Topological insulators Weyl semimetals Research Dr. Burkov'sresearch program at UW has been focused in two distinct directions: strong-correlation and nonequilibrium phenomena in cold atomic gases; and topologically-ordered states of matter, including the recently discovered time-reversal invariant topological insulators. The recent theoretical and experimental discovery of a new solid state of matter, Topological Insulator (TI), is the most exciting event in Condensed Matter Physics in the last two decades. It was ranked by the Science Magazine as one of the top ten breakthroughs in all sciences in the year 2007. Hisgroups research is increasingly focused in this rapidly developing new area and Burkov is currently the only UW faculty member, actively working in this field.
