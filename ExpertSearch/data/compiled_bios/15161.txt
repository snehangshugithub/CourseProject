Personal profile Research interestsMy research is concerned with fundamental development of new analysis tools, algorithms, economic theories to inform next generation of grid operation and planning and market economics, and quantification of whole-system value of low carbon technologies and network flexibility. My research has the following three strands: i) Smart grid modelling, control, operation, planning and pricing, ii) Whole-system approach to business models and business cases for new technologies and economic incentives, iii) Big data analyses for smart grid and smart metering data to substantially improve grid and market operating efficiency.
