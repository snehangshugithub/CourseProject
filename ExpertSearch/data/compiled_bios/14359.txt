She is passionate about interfacing engineering technologies with clinical science to develop systems useful for patient care particularly for technology driven cancer management. Education Ph.D., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2019 M.S., Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, 2014 B.S., Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, 2014 Previous appointments Beckman Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (2019-2021) Research Statement Current clinical approaches either rely on physical changes in cells by manual observation of alterations in tissue morphology or average expression of molecular markers. New technological and analytical advances are needed to capture tumor heterogeneity at spatial-molecular level for improved patient care. The Mittal Research Lab will investigate the molecular, genomic, and immunological signatures of cancer to develop individualized disease management approaches. Multiplexed measurements combined with artificial intelligence will enable the development of disease progression models, early interventions for improved outcomes, and personalized treatment.
