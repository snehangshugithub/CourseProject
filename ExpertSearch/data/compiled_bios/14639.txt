Kingsolver, Joel G. June 14, 2011 Kingsolver, Joel G. Kenan Distinguished Professor jgking@bio.unc.edu 108 Coker Hall (919) 843-6291 (office) Lab Website How do organisms respond and adapt to complex, variable, natural environments? Our research integrates environmental physiology, ecology and evolution to address this question, using a combination of laboratory, field and modeling approaches. Most of our research is with temperate insects and their interactions with plants and parasites, with an emphasis on butterflies and moths; we use Manduca sexta (Tobacco Hornworms) as a model system in many of our studies. One major theme in recent years is plastic and evolutionary responses to human-induced environmental changesclimate change, invasive species, agroecosystemsand their ecological consequences.
