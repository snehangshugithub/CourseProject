Joined Yale Faulty 2013. Donna L. Dubinsky Associate Professor of Computer ScienceAddress:AKW 212, 51 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511203-432-8001ruzica.piskac@yale.eduWebsiteRuzica Piskac is an associate professor at Yale, Computer Science Department. Her research interests span the areas of programming languages, software verification, automated reasoning, and code synthesis. A common thread in Ruzicas research is improving software reliability and trustworthiness using formal techniques. Prior to joining Yale, Ruzica was an independent research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS) in Germany (January 2012-August 2013). She was head of the Synthesis, Analysis and Automated Reasoning Group. Ruzica did her graduate studies at EPFL, Switzerland (2007-2011), where she worked under the supervision of Viktor Kuncak. She was awarded the Patrick Denantes Memorial Prize for her PhD dissertation. She holds a Masters degree in Computer Science, obtained at the Max-Planck Institute for Computer Science in Saarbruecken, Germany, as well as a Masters degree in mathematics from the University of Zagreb, Croatia.
