He has a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Texas A&M University and a Ph.D. in Engineering Mechanics from JNCASR, India. His doctoral research (with Professor Roddam Narasimha) was on the application of vortex methods and statistical mechanics to study turbulent free shear layers. He has been at The University of Texas at Austin since 2016, and works on AFOSR sponsored research (with Professor David Goldstein) on roughness-induced boundary layer transition. The detailed examination of the underlying physical processes using direct numerical simulations has suggested novel transition mitigation strategies such as introducing appropriate surface textures. The outcome of this research could improve the efficiency and endurance of low speed aircraft, as well as wind turbine performance. Dr. Suryanarayanan is also interested in development of numerical methods, vorticity dynamics and control of turbulent flows for mechanical and aerospace engineering applications. Dr. Suryanarayanan has taught courses on fluid mechanics, dynamics, compressible flow, applied aerodynamics and computational fluid dynamics.
