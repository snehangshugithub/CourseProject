Current research activities in vascular mechanics are focused on i) the incipient growth of abdominal aortic aneurysm and ii) the fundamental mechanisms that underlie the mechanical stability of healthy and diseased arterial tissue and its constituents. Research in interface mechanics is concerned with the static and quasi-static analysis of crack-like defects in various geometries/loadings.
