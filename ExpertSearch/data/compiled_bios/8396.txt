He is also interested in strongly correlated classical and quantum condensed matter systems subject to strongly competing, or frustrated, interactions. Gingras lab frequently collaborates with experimentalists to test theoretical ideas developed in the group. They use a variety of analytical and computational methods, including large-scale numerical simulations, to address these areas of research.

He often collaborates with experimentalists both in Canada and internationally, either trying to understand their results or to conceive new experiments to test theoretical ideas developed in his group. More generally, he isintrigued by problems that exhibit interesting and perplexing collective behaviour. To pursue this research, his students and post-docs employ a range of analytical methods as well as a wide variety of computational techniques, often performing large-scale numerical simulations using programs that we develop, test and run on various platforms. The number of students and post-docs in his group varies with time between 3-4 graduate students and a couple of post-docs. Professor Gingras always entertains the interest of potential graduate students and undergraduate students to join the group. Details on specific research projects can be found on Dr. Gingras' site.
