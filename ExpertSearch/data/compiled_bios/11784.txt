His research group addresses these questions using a combination of quantitative molecular approaches, genomics, physiology and modeling. The group is also exploring environmental and evolutionary mechanisms that trigger the emergence of pathogenic variants among microbes.Teaching InterestsEnvironmental MicrobiologySelected PublicationsAcinas, S.G., Marcelino, L., Klepac-Ceraj, V., Polz, M.F.
