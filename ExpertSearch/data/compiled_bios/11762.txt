Together with my students, we develop sophisticated numerical models (MIT Regional Climate Model (MRCM); and the Hydrology, Entomology and Malaria Transmission Simulator (HYDREMATS)) that are used for predicting such impacts at regional scales. We test these models against satellite observations and archived data sets of hydrologic and atmospheric variables, as well as data collected in our own field campaigns.Teaching Interests1.071 Global Change Science1.714 Surface Hydrology1.073 Introduction to Environmental Data AnalysisSelected PublicationsTo view publications, visit:https://eltahir.mit.edu/highlighted-papers/Subscribe to our newsletter Email* EmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
