Saari is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Waterloo. Dr. Saari studies the consequences of climate change and climate policy on human health and environmental inequality. She has 11 years of post-graduate experience in air pollution and air quality modelling at the University of Toronto (2), AECOM (3), Environment and Climate Change Canada (1), and MIT (5). As a professional air quality engineer in Ontario, she completed projects in seven Canadian provinces and territories. Dr. Saari has employed economic models, emissions models, atmospheric chemical transport models, and health response models to assess the costs and co-benefits of climate policy, energy policy, and transportation policy. She has been invited to speak at Harvard University, the University of Toronto, Carleton University, North Carolina State University, and the University of Washington. Her work has been published in Nature Climate Change, and covered in over 16 news outlets including CBC, NBC, and the New York Times. She directly informs policy through invited presentations to state-level policymakers and the U.S. EPA Climate Change Division, and she was cited in an amicus brief submitted by leading climate scientists to the D.C. Circuit Court evaluation of the U.S. Clean Power Plan the Obama Administration's centrepiece climate policy.Research InterestsAir quality impacts of energy and climate policyEnvironmental inequalityAir quality policy analysisSustainable infrastructurePollution and policy impacts by income groupGreenhouse gases and tradeHealth impacts of air pollution under future climateAir pollution impactsIntegrated modellingHealth impact and air quality modellingEducation2015, Doctorate, Engineering Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology2007, Master of Applied Science, Mechanical and Environmental Engineering, University of Toronto2005, Bachelor of Applied Science, Engineering Science, University of TorontoCourses*CIVE 497 - Special Topics in Civil EngTaught in 2016, 2019CIVE 770 - Topics in Environmental EngTaught in 2018, 2019ENVE 277 - Air Quality EngineeringTaught in 2018, 2019ENVE 299 - SeminarTaught in 2016ENVE 335 - Decision Making Enviro Eng.Taught in 2019GEOE 299 - SeminarTaught in 2016* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsChang, Kelly M and Hess, Jeremy J and Balbus, John M and Buonocore, Jonathan J and Cleveland, David A and Grabow, Maggie L and Neff, Roni and Saari, Rebecca K and Tessum, Christopher W and Wilkinson, Paul and others, Ancillary health effects of climate mitigation scenarios as drivers of policy uptake: a review of air quality, transportation and diet co-benefits modeling studies, Environmental Research Letters, 12(11), 2017Saari, Rebecca K and Thompson, Tammy M and Selin, Noelle E, Human health and economic impacts of ozone reductions by income group, Environmental Science & Technology, 51(4), 2017, 1953 - 1961Thompson, Tammy M and Rausch, Sebastian and Saari, Rebecca K and Selin, Noelle E, Air quality co-benefits of subnational carbon policies, Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association, 66(10), 2016, 988 - 1002Yeung, Jamie and Walbridge, Scott and Haas, Carl and Saari, Rebecca, Understanding the total life cycle cost implications of reusing structural steel, Environment Systems and Decisions, 2016, 1 - 20Garcia-Menendez, Fernando and Saari, Rebecca K and Monier, Erwan and Selin, Noelle E, US air quality and health benefits from avoided climate change under greenhouse gas mitigation, Environmental science & technology, 49(13), 2015, 7580 - 7588Thompson, Tammy M and Saari, Rebecca Kaarina and Selin, Noelle Eckley, Air quality resolution for health impact assessment: influence of regional characteristics, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 14(2), 2014, 969 - 978Saari, Rebecca and Selin, Noelle E and Rausch, Sebastian and Thompson, Tammy M, A Self-Consistent Method to Assess Air Quality Co-Benefits from US Climate Policies, Journal of the Air & Waste Management Asso, 65(1), 2014, 74 - 89Thompson, Tammy M and Rausch, Sebastian and Saari, Rebecca K and Selin, Noelle E, A systems approach to evaluating the air quality co-benefits of US carbon policies, Nature Climate Change, 4(10), 2014, 917 - 923Rego-Barcena, Salvador and Mani, Reza and Yang, Fut and Saari, Rebecca and Thomson, Murray J, Real-time, optical measurement of gas temperature and particle emissivity in a full-scale steelmaking furnace, Metallurgical and Materials Transactions B, 40(2), 2009, 158 - 168Wiacek, A and Taylor, JR and Strong, K and Saari, R and Kerzenmacher, TE and Jones, Nicholas B and Griffith, DWT, Ground-Based solar absorption FTIR spectroscopy: characterization of retrievals and first results from a novel optical design instrument at a New NDACC Complementary Station, Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, 24(3), 2007, 432 - 448Rego-Barcena, Salvador and Saari, Rebecca and Mani, Reza and El-Batroukh, Sameh and Thomson, Murray J, Real time, non-intrusive measurement of particle emissivity and gas temperature in coal-fired power plants, Measurement Science and technology, 18(11), 2007In the NewsResearcher examines effects of Canadian wildfiresGraduate StudiesCurrently considering applications from graduate students.
