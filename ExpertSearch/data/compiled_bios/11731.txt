Missouri University of Science and Technology, 2004Ph.D. University of Colorado, Boulder, 2009Post-Doc Stanford University, Materials Science and Engineering, 2010-2013 "We hope to better understand and treat diseases and injuries of the central nervous system, that is, the brain and spinal cord." Kyle J. Lampe, Assistant Professor Kyle is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Virginia, and by courtesy, Biomedical Engineering and Neuroscience. He was previously a Ruth L. Kirschstein NIH NRSA postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University with Prof. Sarah Heilshorn in the department of Materials Science and Engineering. Kyle completed his Ph.D. and B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Colorado, Boulder and the Missouri University of Science and Technology (Rolla, MO), respectively. The Lampe Group investigates biomaterials for tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery within the central nervous system, developing materials including synthetic polymers, recombinant engineered proteins, and self-assembling peptides.
