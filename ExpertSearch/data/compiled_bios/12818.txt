Park among Purdue Engineering faculty to receive prestigious research recognition Clarivate, a global web analytics company, has unveiled its 2021 list ofHighly Cited Researchers. The methodology that determines the who's who of influential researchers draws on the data and analysis performed by bibliometric experts and data scientists at the Institute for Scientific Information at Clarivate. Four Purdue Engineering faculty received recognition. For each this is the second year in a row to earn the honor. Alexandra Boltasseva, the Ron and Dotty Garvin Tonjes Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, was recognized for cross-field impact. She specializes in nanophotonics, optical metamaterials and quantum photonics. Letian Dou, Charles Davidson Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering, was also recognized for cross-field impact. His research focuses on using simple chemistry and physics to design materials that tackle todays most critical energy and sustainability challenges.
