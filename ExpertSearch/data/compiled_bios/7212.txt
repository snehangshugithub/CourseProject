His doctoral work won him a Materials Research Society Graduate Student Award (now known as the Gold Award). He obtained his B.Tech. in Metallurgical Engineering from the IIT, Madras, India, and his M.S. in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of Cincinnati. He was a staff member at Novellus Systems, CA, and a Visiting Scientist at the Physics Department of Linkping University, Sweden, before he joined the Rensselaer faculty in Fall 1998 as an Assistant Professor. He became a tenured Associate Professor in 2003, and was promoted to full Professor in 2006. He was named John Tod Horton Professor in 2013. His research focuses on developing a fundamental understanding of structure-processing-property relationships in molecularly-tailored inorganic thin film and bulk nanomaterials and interfaces, and harnessing them for energy and electronics applications. Professor Ramanath has co-authored 175 journal articles (Google Scholar h-index 50, ~9900 citations), one book chapter, and holds 9 US patents. He has delivered more than 225 invited/plenary/keynote talks worldwide, and has organized several international symposia and workshops for MRS, AVS and TMS. He co-founded ThermoAura Inc, served as the Director of the NY State Center for Future Energy Systems and an Editor of IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology (2003-15), and is an Editorial Advisory Board member for Journal of Experimental Nanoscience.
