Operations Research, Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN B.A. Mathematics and Computer Science, DePauw University, Greencastle, INResearch InterestsThe design and analysis of computer simulation experiments, particularly issues of statistical efficiency (such as variance-reduction techniques), multivariate output analysis (such as multiple-comparison procedures and simulation optimization), multivariate and nonstationary input modeling (such as modeling and generation of nonstationary arrival processes), metamodeling, uncertainty quantification (such as input uncertainty and sensitivity analysis) and computer simulation analytics. Special interest in parallel implementation of simulation optimization methods. Application areas include financial engineering, computer performance modeling, quality control, manufacturing systems and transportation systems. Additional interests in numerical evaluation of non-stationary queueing processes common in telecommunications and service systems.Selected PublicationsJiang, Guangxin; Hong, L.
