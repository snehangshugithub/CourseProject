We focus on the mammalian liver, which has the unique ability to completely regenerate itself, in order to identify the molecular requirements for effective organ repair. To this end, we innovate genetic, molecular, and cellular tools that allow us to investigate and modulate organ injury and regeneration directly within living organisms.
