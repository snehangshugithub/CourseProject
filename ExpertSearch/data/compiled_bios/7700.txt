Her primary research occurs at the intersection of accounting, finance and economics in the area of information and capital markets. Teoh studies how the content, form of presentation and timing of disclosure of accounting information affect firm values, manager and investor behavior and economic welfare. Managers may behave opportunistically to take advantage of investors limited attention to accounting and other value-relevant information, she says. This may cause firm misvaluation. Knowing how and why accounting information may be mispriced provides profit opportunities to those who understand and are attentive to such information. Her current research introduces the visual attention hypothesis: that visuals in firm earnings announcements increase investor attention to earnings news. She and her colleagues find that when visuals attract investor attention to a firms earnings announcements on Twitter, investors respond more strongly to the information in valuing the firm. But visuals can be a double-edged sword, she says. They can encourage investors to overreact by valuing the firm too high initially, and the overvaluation is reversed later. In new research into the ways images convey information to capital market participants, Teoh is studying how face impressions from analysts LinkedIn profile photos are related to their access to information from top management and other industry experts. Analysts who are perceived to look more trustworthy or dominant produce more accurate earnings forecasts. CEOs are more willing to share information with a Trusty Tom analyst, Teoh says. An attractive face confers only a temporary advantage; it helps when analysts are new to the industry, or with new CEOs and CFOs. We find striking gender differences: Female analysts with dominant-looking faces are less accurate, perhaps because they are given less access to insiders. They are also less likely to be voted All-Star status relative to dominant-looking male analysts. These results hint that societal bias and gender stereotypes influence others impressions of female analysts. Teoh received the Moskowitz Prize from the Social Investment Forum for best paper on socially responsible investing. Her work on earnings management has been widely cited by scholars in accounting and finance for the important finding that the market does not efficiently impound managements actions into security prices. She has published more than 50 articles in the leading journals in accounting, finance and economics. Teoh previously served as an assistant professor of accounting at UCLA Anderson and has served on faculty at the University of Michigan and the Ohio State University. She was most recently the Deans Professor of Accounting at UCI Paul Merage School of Business.
