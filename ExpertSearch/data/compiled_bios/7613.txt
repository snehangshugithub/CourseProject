After seven years as assistant professor in the Stanford Graduate School of Business, he joined UCLA Anderson in 1990. His interest in business started in high school when he co-founded a company making telemetry kits to be launched on model rockets. He soon became fascinated by the economics of competition, including in the realm of entrepreneurship and business startups. His research now focuses on issues related to market entry and productivity, broadly defined. Lieberman's teaching and research interests are in the areas of competitive strategy, industrial economics and operations management. He is the author of numerous articles in professional journals, on topics such as cost reduction and productivity improvement, market entry and exit, and strategic investment. His most well-known paper, "First Mover Advantages" (co-authored with David Montgomery), was awarded the 1996 Best Paper Prize by the Strategic Management Society. He is a fellow of the Strategic Management Society and a member of the editorial board of the Strategic Management Journal. Education Ph.D. Business Economics, 1982, Harvard University A.B.
