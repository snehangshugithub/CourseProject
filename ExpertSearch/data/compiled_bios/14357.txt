Schwartz Boeing-Sutter Professor Chemical Engineering Adjunct Professor Materials Science & Engineering Director Clean Energy Institute dts@u.washington.edu (206) 685-4815 BNS 305 Schwartz Group Biography Schwartz is the Boeing-Sutter Professor of Chemical Engineering and the founding director of the UW Clean Energy Institute (CEI). Established with funding from the state of Washington in 2013, CEI supports the advancement of next-generation solar energy and battery materials and devices, as well as their integration with systems and the grid. His research explores transport and reaction in electrochemical systems, including the performance of complex electrodes used in energy storage and conversion. Schwartz served on the Technical Advisory Board for Washingtons Energy Strategy in 2012 and, in 2018, he received the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Science Foundation. He is a Fellow of the Electrochemical Society and a board and executive committee member of the Washington CleanTech Alliance.
