Personal profile Research interestsProfile Ben obtained a first-class MEng degree in Electronic & Electrical Engineering and a PhD in biomedical engineering from the University of Bath in 2012 and 2016 respectively. He has held the RB Whorrod scholarship and the prestigious Nicholson doctoral scholarship. He has worked in the medical devices sector for Siemens Healthcare and holds multiple patents in the area of biomedical engineering. Since 2016, he has been an Assistant Professor at the University of Bath and a co-founder of the Centre for Biosensors, Bioelectronics, and Biodevices the largest research centre of its type in England. In that time, he has published over 30 peer reviewed research papers, co-authored two book chapters on neural interfaces, and supervised six doctoral students. He holds a number of internal and external posts including as a Director of Studies and a trustee and non-executive director of both the Institute for Physics and Engineering in Medicine and the charity Designability. His research interests are in the areas of neural interfaces, neural computing, and signal processing. He recently took part in an IPR Policy Fellowship on AI and discussed various issues surrounding the regulation of such devices and data generation issues and possibilities with AI in Healthcare.
