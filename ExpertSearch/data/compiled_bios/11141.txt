Why do we sometimes sacrifice our own welfare to improve the welfare of someone else? I address these questions by mapping the cognitive and emotional mechanisms that enable human sociality. To understand how these mechanisms operate, we need to understand how they were created -- that is, how they evolved. These mechanisms evolved for a lifestyle vastly different from modern mass societies; they evolved for the face-to-face communities of our forager ancestors. By using knowledge of the past to map the present design of human psychology, we can understand how the mind produces behavior in modern political, business, and institutional environments.
