Research active faculty members operate within three major cluster areas: Neuroscience, Cell Biology and Biochemistry, as well as Organismal Behavior and Physiology. Many of these faculty members offer training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows. The research interests of the CBN faculty span a wide variety of important and cutting-edge areas of neuroscience in neurological disorders, spinal cord injury, stem cell research, immunology, cancer pathogenesis, gene expression and much more. Research is being conducted in humans, mice, zebrafish, fruit flies, nematodes, yeast, and bacteria. Members of the faculty receive competitive research grants from Federal institutes including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Defense, as well as the State of New Jersey and private foundations.
