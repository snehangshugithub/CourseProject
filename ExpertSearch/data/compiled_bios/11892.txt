Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, 2012 Research Interests: Computational Fluid DynamicsFlow ControlUnsteady AerodynamicsModal/Non-modal AnalysisData Science Current Research: Dr. Suns research interests focus on understanding the underlying physics of fluid flows and designing physics-driven control strategies using computational fluid dynamics, modal/non-modal analysis, and data science. The ability to control fluid flow behaviors can lead to quiet, economical, and efficient systems in fluid mechanics and aerodynamics. Because of high dimensionality, strong nonlinearity, and complexity in fluid physics, design of effective control strategies can be challenging. Dr. Suns research focuses on uncovering underlying physics of complex fluid flows using the cutting-edge technique of modal analysis, such as dynamic mode decomposition, global stability analysis, and resolvent analysis. The insights obtained from these analyses provide guidance for physics-driven control designs.
