He holds a Ph.D. degree in Physics from the Niels Bohr Institute (1984). He joined the UIC Faculty in 1987 after 3 years as Postdoctoral Researcher at the Hebrew University and the Ohio State University. During 1994-1999 he was the Chairperson of the Department's Educational Policy Committee. His current scientific interests include: Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchies of the soliton equations, the affine Lie algebraic methods and the dressing techniques, (3+1)-dimensional integrable theories and Hopfions (static, soliton solutions with non-zero Hopf topological +charges), Toda field theory, topological charges, Skyrme model, BRS techniques and quantization, methods for constrained systems, supersymmetry, nonlinear dynamical systems, conformal field theory and W-algebra, Yang-Baxter equations, Knot theory. H. Aratyn has co-edited two books on the topics of integrable models and is in the process of editing Proceedings of the Nato Advanced Resaearch Workshop organized in the summer 2000 at UIC.
