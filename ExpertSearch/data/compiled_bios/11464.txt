She uses methods from engineering mechanics, materials science, and cell and molecular biology to investigate how mechanical signals (forces and displacements) contribute to the development, adaptation, degeneration, and regeneration of bone and cartilage. This work involves experimentation, computational modeling, and theoretical analysis. Through her research, Professor Morgan hopes to gain insight into causes and potential treatments for diseases or conditions such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and impaired bone healing. Professor Morgans current research projects are in the use of mechanical stimulation to promote cartilage formation, the biomechanics of spine fractures and bone fracture healing, structure-function relationships in ischemic bone, and non-invasive diagnostics of bone fracture healing. She is the recipient of several reserach and teaching awards, including the 2006 Young Investigator Award from the International Osteoporosis Foundation.
