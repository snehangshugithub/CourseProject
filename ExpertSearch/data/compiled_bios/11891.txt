(thesis) in Mechanical Engineering, University of Florida, 2006B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, 2003 Lab/Center Affiliations: Multiscale Research & Engineering Laboratory [MREL]Syracuse Center of ExcellenceCASE Research Interests: Energy & thermal managementWater desalination & filtrationBio-mechanical systems Current Research: Multiscale Research & Engineering Laboratory (MREL) is a research group of Prof. Shalabh C. Maroo in the College of Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University. The groups research interests are highly multidisciplinary, in the areas of multi-scale transport phenomenon, thermal management, and bio-mechanical systems with a focus on energy and water desalination, and an emphasis on using the fundamentals of nano-science and nano-technology to build efficient macro-scale mechanical systems. His recent work includes, (1) thin-film evaporation heat transfer at the nanoscale to achieve ultra-high heat fluxes for efficient thermal management, (2) fundamental investigation and visualization of contact line and microlayer, (3) surface and transport properties of ionic solution in tobacco mosaic virus for water desalination. All three research methods are pursued: theoretical analysis, computational simulations (molecular dynamics and CFD) and experimental techniques (including nano-metrology and nanofabrication). In addition, Professor Maroo has also been greatly involved in (a) utilization of solar energy, (b) improving building energy efficiency, and (c) design of a novel adsorbtion battery to provide heating and cooling in electric vehicles.
