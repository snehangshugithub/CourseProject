A key aim here is to use the appropriate blend of accuracy in the fundamental physics versus more phenomenological physical descriptions, in conjunction with advanced numerical algorithmic schemes, to create simulation programs that can accurately predict the processes and device behavior with reasonable execution times. By creating such programs with fast execution times and good numerical robustness properties, and by ensuring that adequate calibration procedures are followed, then the speed of semiconductor technology development can be significantly improved, costly experiments can be reduced, and better design points can be achieved. Dr. Coles research work has entailed thermodynamic analysis of operations performed on electrodynamic systems consisting of classical charged particles interacting with classical electromagnetic radiation, including zero-point radiation, and the predicted thermal-like effects of accelerating simple electromagnetic systems through the vacuum. Current research activities include improvements in microlithography simulation models and methods, and thermodynamic considerations of advanced energy extraction mechanisms.
