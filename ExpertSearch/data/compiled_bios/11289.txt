His research interests are focused on heat stress management in dairy and beef cattle and the development of improvement strategies for genetic selection of production traits. He spent a one-year sabbatical at the University of Florida in 2007 and returns to the department yearly to conduct collaborative research on the genetic basis for thermotolerance in cattle. Ignacio R. Ipharraguerre ipharraguerre@foodsci.uni-kiel.de Dr.Ipharraguerre is a Senior Scientist at the Institute of Human Nutrition and Food Science, University of Kiel, Germany. He received a degree in Agricultural Sciences (1996) from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, and an M.S. (2001) and Ph.D. (2004) in Animal Sciences focused on nutritional physiology of dairy cows from the University of Illinois, USA. In his current position,he leads researchon the impact of diet on the enterohepatic system and the resulting immunometabolic implications for the host, with special emphasis on bile acid metabolism and signaling. He is also deeply interested in developing and expanding the use of Drosophila melanogaster in nutritional research and health. Sha Tao stao@uga.edu Sha Tao is an associate professor in the Department of Animal and Dairy Science at the University of Georgia.
