I joined the Neuroscience enterprise at Brown in 1989, where I currently serve as Professor of Neuroscience and Director of MRI Research for Brown University. From 1997-2000, I directed the Functional Neuroimaging Laboratory at Foundation Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy. I have served on numerous panels that have reviewed grant proposals, including the NIH, Wellcome Trust, Human Frontiers Program and the Italian Space Agency. I have or currently serve on the editorial boards of major neuroscience journals, including the Journal of Neuroscience, Neuroscience, NeuroImage and Experimental Brain Research. I have published 90 papers in peer-reviewed journals and other fora. Brown Affiliations Neuroscience Robert J. and Nancy D.

Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview I study brain mechanisms underlying motor control, motor learning and action intention. Several brain regions, including the frontal and parietal lobes, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum, have involvement in voluntary movements, and these areas become engaged when humans learn and then consolidate new motor skills and prepare and shift intentions. Currently, we study these problems with magnetic resonance imaging and surface brain electrical recordingtechnology that assesses focal changes in blood flow and brain currents, respectively, and by assessing movement patterns while humans perform various movement tasks.
