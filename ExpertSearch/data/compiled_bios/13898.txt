We unveil, often for the first time, that these clusters exist in living cells, and expand on imaging approaches as well as cellular and molecular biology techniques to discover the biophysical mechanisms of action and their function in vivo. The Ciss will be moving to Caltech in 2021, and is no longer accepting students at MIT.
