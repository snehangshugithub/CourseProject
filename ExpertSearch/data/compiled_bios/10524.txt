Working with a team of more than 200 experts, including doctors, engineers and fellow dark matter physicists, the Mechanical Ventilator Milano went from concept to FDA approval in just 42 days, and it is now in full production. The ventilators are designed specifically for COVID-19 patients and can be assembled from off-the-shelf components. The full version now in production runs between $5,000 and 6,000 making the MVM many times less expensive than other ventilators on the market. Listen to the podcast My interests lie at the intersection of particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. Dark matter: Recent observations from WMAP have demonstrated that a large fraction of the energy in the Universe - 25% - is in the form of cold matter that does not clump and does not shine light. This dark matter is one of the fundamental constituents of the Universe and, to date, has not been directly observed. Dark matter could be made by massive particles interacting very weakly with regular matter. The Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) predicted by the Super Symmetric extensions of the Standard Model are an excellent candidate for dark matter. I am exploring new ideas on direct Dark Matter detection using argon and xenon as targets. I am a member of the WARPand DarkSide collaborations, which are carrying out a program for direct dark matter searches with argon. I am a member of the MAX collaboration, which is engineering two giant xenon and depleted argon detectors for the upcoming US national lab for underground physics. Solar Neutrinos: I am a member of the Borexino collaboration. Borexino is a liquid scintillator detector built and operated at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. It is the only experiment ever built capable of observing in real time the low energy (<1 MeV) portion of the solar neutrino spectrum. Borexino is currently taking data, and we hope that our observation with the detector will help us solve some of the remaining puzzles on the Sun and on solar neutrinos.Teaching: 2010/11 - PHY101 Research Opportunities: I am looking for graduate students to participate in the programs for direct detection of dark matter and measurement of solar neutrinos.
