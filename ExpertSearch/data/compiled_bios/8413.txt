Chemical Engineering Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 1998 ResearchInterests Our primary research interests focus on developing: biomaterials that mimic the complex structure and biochemistry of human tissues novel tools to probe 3D tissue environments. Particular interest centers on delineating quantitative relationships between properties of tissues or three-dimensional cell scaffolds and the elicited signaling mechanisms of cells growing within these systems. Scaffolds to support neural regeneration and transplant of neural stem cells In vitro models of nervous system physiology and disease Novel sensors for mapping hypoxia growing tissues and tumors Bioinspired and naturally-derived biomaterials Selected Publications Google Scholar Zahra Ghassemi, Sam Ruesing, Jennie B Leach, Silviya P Zustiak.
