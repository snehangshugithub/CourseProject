In 1982 he joined British Telecom Research Laboratories in their submarine optical transmission systems division. At BT he pioneered the concept of unrepeatered transmission systems and in 1987 was promoted to head the transatlantic link repeater group. In 1988, he became Senior Lecturer at Essex University where his research interests widened to also include access network technologies. He was promoted to Full Professor in 2004. Recent involvement with the EPSRC included the platform grants EP/E04610X/1: Future Photonic Networks and GR/S82695/01: Next Generation Photonic Networks. He has maintained extensive involvement in EU projects projects such as MUSE-1, MUSE-2, UROOF, OASE, STRONGEST, FIVER, and SODALES. He has also been active in the Networks of Excellence, e-Photon/One, e-Photon/One+ and BONE. He leads the Access Group at Essex University which conducts research on wireless and wireline media for the last mile.
