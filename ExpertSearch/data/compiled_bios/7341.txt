B.A., Mathematics, University of California, Berkeley, USA, 1985. Research Interests My research interests are in geometric analysis, geometric group theory, and geometric topology. These areas involve a mixture of ideas from geometry, analysis, topology, and algebra. Current research topics include: Geometric evolution equations: Ricci flow and mean curvature flow. Quasi-isometric rigidity. Quasisymmetric structure of self-similar spaces, such as boundaries of hyperbolic groups. Bilipschitz embedding problems. Analysis on singular spaces, e.g. Carnot groups, and spaces satisfying Poincare inequalities. Selected Publications J. Cheeger and B.
