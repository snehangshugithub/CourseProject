Tinsley Oden Professor Founding Director of Institute for Computational Engineering Cockrell Family Regents Chair in Engineering #2 Department Research Areas: Computational Engineering Education:Ph.D., Oklahoma State University Research Interests: Computational Mechanics Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equations Computational and Applied Mathematics Dr. Oden's research focuses on contemporary topics in computational sciences and mathematics, including modeling and simulation of stochastic systems in material science, uncertainty quantification, Bayesian inference, a posteriori estimation of modeling and discretization errors, and modeling of tumor growth in living tissues. Applications of current interest include molecular dynamics, modeling of semi-conductor manufacturing processes, and phase-field models of tumor growth. He has been on the Cockrell School of Engineering faculty since 1973 and is also a Professor of Mathematics and a Professor of Computer Sciences. He has published more than 700 technical articles and reports, and authored or edited 57 books. Dr. Oden is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and is the recipient of many national and international awards, including 10 medals, six honorary doctorates, the Chevalier de l'ordre des Palmes Acadmiques from the French government, and the recipient of the 2013 Honda Prize for his role in establishing the field of computational mechanics.
