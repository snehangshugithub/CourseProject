University of California, San Diego 2000M.S. University of California, San Diego 2002Ph.D. University of California, San Diego 2005 "Network modeling of biological systems to predict drug targets and understand mechanisms of disease." Jason Papin, Professor Jason Papin develops computational models of cellular networks and performing high-throughput experiments to characterize biological systems relevant to human disease. After his training in Bioengineering at the University of California, San Diego, Jason Papin joined the faculty at the University of Virginia in 2005. He is now a Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering His lab works on problems in systems biology, metabolic network analysis, infectious disease, toxicology, heart disease, and cancer, developing computational approaches for integrating high-throughput data into predictive computational models. He manages a lab with both experimental and computational activities and his research group has had continuous support with funding from the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation (including as a CAREER award recipient), Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and several private foundations and companies. Jason is an elected fellow of the Biomedical Engineering Society and the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering. Jason serves as the Co-Editor-in-Chief of PLOS Computational Biology as well as on the editorial board of other journals in the field of computational biology. His service to the scientific community also includes effort as a past elected member of the Board of Directors of the Biomedical Engineering Society, previously as a standing member of the Biodata Management and Analysis (BDMA) NIH study section, and numerous other review panels of federal funding agencies. His teaching and mentoring have been recognized with receipt of awards for Excellence in Biomedical Engineering Undergraduate Education at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral training levels. He is the past director of the Biomedical Engineering graduate program at the University of Virginia. Jasons work also bridges the basic-translational axis with recognition as an inventor on several disclosures of intellectual property, in addition to consulting with multiple biotechnology companies.
