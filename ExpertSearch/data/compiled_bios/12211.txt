In addition, I have a focus on libraries, how they work, how they change, how they have evolved, and what we can learn and adopt from previous practice, blended with new and exciting ideas, to keep libraries of all kinds vital, necessary and important parts of their communities. I teach courses in information sources and services, in search, in research methods and statistics, and the broad information field in general.
