University of Virginia, 1984Ph.D. University of Virginia, 1989 Prof. Knospe has worked on a variety of research problems in control and mechatronics, including magnetic levitation, vibration control, control of machining chatter, and stability and performance of time-delay systems. Recently, his research has focused on the use of capillary interfaces in micromechatronic systems, including electrowetting, capillary force actuation, and liquid-liquid interface sensors. Dr. Knospe has served as an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology, IEEE Control Systems Magazine, and Mechatronics. In the News U.Va. Teams Dominate Engineering Competition U.Va. Teams Dominate Engineering Competition Alex Russomanno, a fourth-year student majoring in mechanical engineering, won gold medals for best oral presentation and best technical content for his lecture on micro-actuators, which he has been researching with Carl Knospe, associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering. Russomanno will advance to the finals during the event in Houston.
