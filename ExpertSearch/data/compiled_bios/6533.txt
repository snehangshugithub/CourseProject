(1974) and M.Sc. (1982) degrees in aeronautical engineering from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, and a Ph.D. (1990) in aerospace engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles. He also holds a high-school teaching credential in technology education from the Technion's Department of Education in Technology and Science (1974). After obtaining his undergraduate degrees he served in the Israeli Air Force in research and development roles, eventually founding its aeroelasticity / structural dynamic section. After graduating UCLA Prof. Livne joined the faculty of the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the University of Washington in 1990.Over the course of his academic career, Prof. Livne has continued extensive collaboration with both industry and defense organizations. Highlights of these collaborations include structural and aeroelastic optimization and lightweight airframe design with Boeing Commercial Aircraft, membership on the NASA-Boeing High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) Aeroelastic Concept Evaluation Team and the Boeing HSCT Aeroservoelastic working group, and contributions to industry / government wind tunnel aeroelastic tests of highly nonlinear flight vehicle configurations.Prof. Livne headed the airplane design education program at the University of Washington for many years and continues to teach airplane design and carry out research in this area.. His accomplishments have been recognized by an ASME/Boeing Structures & Materials Award (1998), NSF National Young Investigator Award, and earlier the Josephine de Karman Fellowship. With expertise in aeroelasticty, aeroservoelasticity, multidisciplinary flight vehicle optimization, aircraft design, aerospace structures, structural optimization, and structural dynamics, Professor Livne's research has been funded by NASA, the FAA, AFOSR, ONR, NSF, and by Boeing. He was an associate editor for the AIAA Journal and a guest editor for a Journal of Aircraft special section on MDO. He was one of the launch section editors for the Encyclopedia of Aerospace Engineering and has published about a hundred journal and conference papers. Currently, Prof. Livne is the Editor-in-Chief of the AIAA's (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics) Journal of Aircraft. He is a Fellow of the AIAA.Professor Livne is the recipient of the AIAA Ashley Award for Aeroelasticity for 2021 "For carrying out foundational works for aeroservoelastic optimization; leadership in maturing active flutter suppression to practice, and for major contributions to dissemination of aeroelastic knowledge."
