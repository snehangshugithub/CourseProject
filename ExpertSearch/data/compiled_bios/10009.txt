He started his research group in January of 2014 after obtaining his PhD from Tel Aviv University and spending some time as a postdoc at the Broad Institute and Harvard Medical School. The overarching goal of his research is to utilize high-throughput genomic data sets, mostly based on DNA sequencing, in order to build models that explain how gene expression is regulated. He is especially interested in immune cells, covering various aspects of their biology, such as their differentiation, stability/ plasticity, and response to acute stimulation.
