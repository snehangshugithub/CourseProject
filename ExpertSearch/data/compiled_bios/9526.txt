Hariri Building 595 Commonwealth Avenue Boston, MA 02215 Download CV Im a behavioral scientist, named one of The 40 Most Outstanding B-School Profs Under 40 In The World (Poets&Quants, 2014). With my focus on behavioral economics, I investigate how expectations, emotions, peers, and random cues in the environment affect how we think about products, money, investments, and morality, and their implications for welfare, development, and policy. My research topics range from the dishonesty of honest people to irrational attraction to free products, the paradoxes of green behavior, tax compliance, organ and blood donation, and nudges to reduce credit card delinquency. I was nominated for the SSHRC Aurora Prize for Outstanding New Researcher in Canada, and am the recipient of several teaching and research awards, including the William F. ODell Award of AMAs Journal of Marketing Research (for having made the most significant, long-term contribution to marketing theory, methodology, and/or practice with my 2008 JMR paper on Dishonesty). I have published my research in leading academic journals like the Journal of Marketing Research, Psychological Sciences, Review of Economic Studies, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Popular accounts of my work have appeared among others on NPR, BBC, in the New York Times, Financial Times, Wired, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, and Harvard Business Reviews Breakthrough Ideas. Other popular accounts of my work have been featured in the New York Times bestsellers Drive by Daniel Pink as well as Predictably Irrational, The Upside of Irrationality, The (Honest) Truth about Dishonesty, and Money and Sense by Dan Ariely, and in the 2015 documentary movie (Dis)HonestyThe Truth About Lies by Yael Melamede. Aside from my research, I have given public talks on topics involving various aspects of consumer behavior, behavioral economics, ethics, and policy. Engagements include the Canada Revenue Agency, European Commission, OECD, Toyota, Google Ventures, and TEDxToronto. Most recently, I acted as the senior behavioral scientist of the World Banks behavioral insights team (eMBeD) in Washington DC, with which I am still affiliated. Additionally, I serve as advisor on boards of various government and non-for-profit organizations (past and current engagements include the Privy Council Office Innovation Hub for Behavioral Economics in Canada, the Austrian Minister for Family and Youth, and Irrational Labs in San Francisco, CA). Before joining academia I worked with a spin-off of KPMG as a management consultant in Europe. Before becoming a professor, I was a post-doctoral associate and lecturer in marketing at MIT Sloan School of Management and the MIT Media Lab (Dan Arielys eRationality Group).
