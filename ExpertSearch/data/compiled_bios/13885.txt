Walker American Cancer Society Professor; Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor Graham C. Walker studies DNA repair, mutagenesis, and cellular responses to DNA damage, as well as the symbiotic relationship between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. 617-253-6716 Phone 68-633 Office gwalker@mit.edu Email Lab Website Mary Gallagher Assistant 617-253-6711 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1974, University of Illinois BS, 1970, Chemistry, Carleton University Research Summary Our research is concentrated in two major areas. First, we aim to understand how the proteins involved in DNA repair, mutagenesis and other cellular responses to DNA damage are regulated. Some of our discoveries have the potential to improve chemotherapy. Second, we probe how nitrogen-fixing nodules develop on legumes, and the relationship between rhizobial functions required for nodule invasion/infection and mammalian pathogenesis.
