Her classes include Speech and Hearing Science for freshman and Introduction to Audiology and Aural Rehabilitation for juniors and seniors as well as Advanced Audiology and Aural Rehabilitation in the Master's Program. Teaching is a passion for Newport and her philosophy is to guide each student in learning well. Her goal for speech-language pathology students is that they will understand hearing loss and its implications in their work. For students who decide to work exclusively with the Deaf or hard of hearing, she enjoys mentoring and guiding them in career paths in audiology or auditory verbal therapy or Deaf studies. Students learn in the classroom and in the field, using state-of-the-art audiology equipment. Newport has recently contributed to a book that was translated into Lebanese about including children with disabilities in the classroom. Since there is no separation between life as a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ and work, Newport enjoys integrating faith into the classroom, life discussions and course material.Affiliations 2006-2008 Online Professor, California State University, San Bernardino Taught school nurses how to screen hearing.
