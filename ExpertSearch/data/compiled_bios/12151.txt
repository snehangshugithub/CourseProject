He has also been the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies, Director of the University of Waterloo United Arab Emirates Campus in Dubai, Associate Dean of Engineering (Computing), and the Associate Dean of Engineering (Graduate Studies). Professor Douglas was a founding member of WISE the Waterloo Institute for Sustainable Energy at UWaterloo. His primary research area of interest is in the development and application of PSE technology to industrial processes, including process modelling, simulation, control and optimization. He is working on simulation and optimization issues related to the mitigation and capture of carbon dioxide from large scale emitters. He is not accepting new students. Professor Douglas has consulted on a worldwide basis for many clients and has worked in Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, the UAE. Additionally, he is a co-inventor of the Dryer Master online measurement and control systems for the food processing industry; such systems are finding widespread use in Canada, USA, Europe, and Asia. In addition to his research work, Professor Douglas has co-authored more than 200 related research publications and has supervised more than 80 postgraduate students.Research InterestsProcess Systems Engineering (PSE)Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)Process SimulationOptimization and ControlEnergy PlanningEducation1981, Doctorate, Chemical Engineering, University of Waterloo1977, Master's, Chemical Engineering, University of Waterloo1974, Bachelor's, Chemical Engineering, University of WaterlooCourses*CHE 420 - Intro to Process ControlTaught in 2016, 2018CHE 516 - Energy Systems EngineeringTaught in 2017, 2019CHE 725 - Res Tpcs in Chem Proc AnalysisTaught in 2018* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsA.
