University of Madras, IndiaM.S. Indian Institute of Technology at MadrasPh.D. Indian Institute of Technology at MadrasPost-Doc University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA Dr. Periasamy is an internationally recognized expert in advanced microscopy techniques, particularly in the area of molecular imaging in living cells, tissue and animal. A key area of his research is focused on the design and development of optical methodology including advanced light microscopy techniques to investigate/monitor exogenous and endogenous protein-protein interactions, intravital imaging and monitoring the physical parameters of normal versus cancer cells/tissues. Dr. Periasamy is the founder and center director of the internationally known W.M. Keck Center for Cellular Imaging (KCCI;http://www.kcci.virginia.edu/). Dr. Periasamy is one of the pioneers in the development of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) for measuring the oscillations in cytosolic and nuclear free calcium in single intact living cells. He developed a 2- and 3-color steady state, confocal, multiphoton, and FLIM based Frster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging system for protein localization in living specimens. He has published over 100 articles in refereed journals and book chapters. He has given more than 140 invited lectures nationally and internationally. Dr. Periasamy has edited three books, series book editor on cellular and clinical imaging (6 books), Chairperson in organizing an annual International conference on Multiphoton Microscopy in the Biomedical Sciences through SPIE (since 2001) and runs a hands on training annual workshop on FLIM & FRET Microscopy at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville during March (since 2002). Dr. Periasamy was elected Fellow members of the SPIE Optical Society in 2012. Research Interests Medical and Molecular Imaging Selected Publications "Advanced light microscopy".
