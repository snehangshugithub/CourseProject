My lab is currently exploring two major frontiers of research: (1) microfluidic-based 3D human tissue and tumor models that can be used for preclinical drug evaluation and personalized medicine and (2) wearable graphene oxide (GO)-based biosensors for mobile health. These are student-centric efforts that are aimed at envisioning the transformative use of our ideas. My laboratory has produced 7 winners of the New Jersey Inventors Hall of Fame Graduate Student Award over the past decade. One of the students co-founded Bonbouton to commercialize our sensor technology. Also, several undergraduate and high school students perform research every year in my laboratory with notably one of them, David Monteiro, receiving the prestigious Barry Goldwater Scholarship in 2013.ExperienceProfessor and Chair, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Stevens Institute of Technology, 2020 - presentProfessor, Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Stevens Institute of Technology, 1997- presentGeorge Meade Bond Chair of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Stevens Institute of Technology, 2009-2019Chair, Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Stevens Institute of Technology, 2001-2005Associate Professor, Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Stevens Institute of Technology, 1997-2001Research Staff Member, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, July 1992 to July 1997Research Scientist, United Technologies Research Center, February 1990 to July 1992Institutional ServiceDepartment Chair ChairHonors and AwardsMaster of Engineering (Honoris Causa): Stevens Institute of Technology, 2008Academic Research Award: Printed Electronics USA Conference, 2011Professional SocietiesThe American Ceramic Soceity FellowAAAS American Association for the Advancement of Science MemberGrants, Contracts, and Funds41 grants and contracts received primarily from ARDEC, DOE, NIH, NSF, and ONR.
