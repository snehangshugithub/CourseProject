Since 2004, Lu has applied this cutting-edge technique to study important biological processes in relation to diseases and their treatments, particularly in the field of oncology.This innovative approach has led to the creation of a brand-new research field, where the femtosecond time-resolved laser spectroscopy was successfully incorporated with molecular biology and cell biology methods to advance our understanding of human diseases and their treatments. Lu coined the term femtomedicine (FMD) on his breakthroughs in 2010 [QB Lu, Reviews in Mutation Research 704, 190199(2010)]. Through his research in FMD, Lu has discovered a novel molecular mechanism of DNA damage and a new family of non-platinum-based halogenated molecules, called FMD compounds. The latter have a unique molecular mechanism of action, generating a destroying effect in the intracellular environment of cancerous cells while having a protective effect on healthy/normal cells. FMD compounds therefore naturally and selectively target and kill cancer cells. They are effective in treating a variety of in vitro cancer cell lines and in vivo animal cancer models while exhibiting no systemic and radiation toxicities toward normal cells/tissues. These findings were recently published in the Cell Press and Lancets EBioMedicine, and in AACRs Molecular Cancer Therapeutics. Lu is now translating findings arising from fundamental FMD studies into cancer therapies in the clinic. The success will lead to novel targeted chemotherapies and radiotherapies with minimal side effects and better targeting to treat a variety of cancers. Lu also made important discoveries for the sciences underlying ozone depletion and global climate change. His theories have fundamentally challenged the previous conclusions by the Novel Prize winners in the formation of the ozone hole and global warming (1995 Nobel Chemistry and 2007 Novel Peace awards) and provided the best predictions that agree with up-to-date observations. His pioneering contributions were summarized in his monographic book entitled New Theories and Predictions of the Ozone Hole and Climate Change published recently by World Scientific Inc. (New Jersey, London, Singapore, Beijing, etc., 2015) pp.1-308.
