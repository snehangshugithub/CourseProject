My first book,Secret Trades, Porous Borders: Smuggling and States Along a Southeast Asian Frontier(Yale, 2005), examined many of these ideas by analyzing the history of smuggling in the region. My last book project was calledThe Longest Journey: Southeast Asians and the Pilgrimage to Mecca(Oxford, 2013), and this book attempted to write a history of this very broad topic from earliest times to the present. I am also the editor or co-editor of a number of other books, on the global Hajj (Cambridge, 2016); on trans-nationalism in Asia as seen through time-periods (Harvard, 2015a), through place (Harvard, 2015b), as well as through people (Harvard, 2019); on Burmese lives under a coercive regime (Oxford, 2014); on the state of the field of Indonesian Studies (Cornell, 2014), and Indonesian sources more generally (Duke, 2009); on Chinese trade down to Southeast Asia (Duke, 2009), and Southeast Asian contacts west to the Middle East (Stanford, 2009); and finally on the relationship between History and Anthropology as disciplines (Stanford, 2009). Im now working on a book about the linked maritime histories of Asia, from Yemen east to Yokohama.
