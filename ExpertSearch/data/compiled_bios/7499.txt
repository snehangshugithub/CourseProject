We seek to understand the meaning of these dynamics for perception, and the mechanisms that generate them. We are currently testing hypotheses as to the computational value and origins of neocortical oscillations, and the role that non-neuronal systems (e.g., the vasculature) may play in information processing. To address these questions, we integrate behavior, optogenetics, electrophysiology and imaging. Brown Affiliations Neuroscience Robert J. and Nancy D.
