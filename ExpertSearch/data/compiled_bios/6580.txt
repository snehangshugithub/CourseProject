Of particular interest are addressing challenges associated with passing information between length scales spanning the nano, micro, meso and macroscales as well as the associated time scales of physical phenomena of interest which can range from femtoseconds and microseconds to years. Essential components of the multiscale model development approach are the verification and validation efforts, the latter providing impetus for our interest in multiscale characterization efforts which can be used to help generate statistically meaningful representative volume elements and to provide measurable checks for predictions at each scale. Research Interests: Structures and Materials Micromechanics Analysis of Composites & Nanocomposites Capturing Damage Initiation and Evolution in Composites via Cohesive Zone and Continuum Damage Models Bridging Atomistic and Continuum Length and Time Scales in Nanocomposites Multiscale Mdoeling of Multifunctional Composites for Sensors and Actuators Micromechanics/Multiscale Modeling of Materials with Time-Varying/Evolving Effective Properties Meshless Computational Tools in Solid Mechanics for Dynamic Materials and Composites Service to the profession and society Leadership in Professional Societies: Chair, AIAA Materials Technical Committee, 2013-2015 Vice Chair, AIAA Materials Technical Committee, 2011-2013 Secretary, AIAA Materials Technical Committee, 2010-2011 Chair, Adaptive Structures and Materials Systems Branch in the Aerospace Division of ASME, 2019-2020 Vice Chair, Adaptive Structures and Materials Systems Branch in the Aerospace Division of ASME, 2018-2019 Treasurer, Adaptive Structures and Materials Systems Branch in the Aerospace Division of ASME, 2017-2018 Secretary, Adaptive Structures and Materials Systems Branch in the Aerospace Division of ASME, 2016-2017 Chair, ASME Active and Multifunctional Materials TC, 2018-2019 Co-Chair, ASME Active and Multifunctional Materials TC, 2016-2018 Member, Adaptive Structures and Materials Systems Branch in the Aerospace Division of ASME, 2015-Present Member, ASME Active and Multifunctional Materials TC, 2013-Present Member, AIAA Materials Technical Committee, 2010-Present Member, ASME Composites and Heterogeneous Materials Technical Committee, 2008-2014 Member, ASME Materials Technical Committee, 2008-2014 Mentor, NASA Motivating Undergraduates in Science and Technology (MUST) Journal Editorial Service Applied Mechanics Reviews Associate Editor Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures Associate Editor Journal of Peridynamics and Nonlocal Modeling Editorial Board Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology Simulation at the Nanoscale - Editorial Board Smart Materials and Structures Guest Associate Editor: Focus on Recent Advances in Adaptive and Active Materials (SMASIS) Multifunctional Materials Professional Society Membership: Associate Fellow, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Fellow, American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Member, American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Member, Society of Engineering Science (SES) Honors & awards ASME Fellow, 2020 AIAA Associate Fellow, 2013 2021 AFRL Summer Faculty Fellow - Eglin AFB (HERD) 2018 AFRL Summer Faculty Fellow - Eglin AFB (HERD) 2017 AFRL Summer Faculty Fellow - Eglin AFB (HERD) Oak Ridge Associated Universities Ralph E.
