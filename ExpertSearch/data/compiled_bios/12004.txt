People Professor Kun Yang People Professor Kun Yang Professor School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CSEE) Email kunyang@essex.ac.uk Location 1NW.4.20, Colchester Campus Academic support hours 10am-12noon, Thursday during term time Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Biography Head of the Network Convergence Laboratory (NCL) Leader of the Communications and Networks Research Group I received my PhD degree from University College London (UCL) in the area of communication networks and services. After 3 years' post-doc research in the Department of EEE at UCL working on EU research projects such as FAIN (Future Active IP Networks), MANTRIP and CONTEXT, I moved to University of Essex at 2003 to become an academic staff. Now I am a Chair Professor in the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CSEE), University of Essex, leading the Network Convergence Laboratory (NCL) and the Communications and Networks Research Group. My current research activities are focused on advancing new technologies related to communication and network systems, and on the fundamentals underlying them, including communication theory, network science, machine learning and edge intelligence. In particular I am interested in energy aspects of future communication systems such as 6G, promoting energy self-sustainability via both energy efficiency (green communications and networking) and energy harvesting. I have published 150+ journal papers in the above areas. I manage research projects funded by various sources such as UK EPSRC, EU FP7/H2020 and industries (e.g., British Telecom) and coordinated one EU FP7 research project. I have been a Judge of GSMA Global Mobile Awards 2019 and 2020 (MWC-Barcelona) and a member of UK EPSRC Peer Review College for many years. I serve on editorial boards of both IEEE journals (including IEEE Trans. and IEEE Communications Magazine) and non-IEEE journals (e.g., Area Editor of IET Smart Cities). I have been actively organizing international conferences/symposia/workshops, such as IEEE ComSoc flagship conference Globecom. I am a Distinguished Lecturer of IEEE ComSoc (2020-2021).
