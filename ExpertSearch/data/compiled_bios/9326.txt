I am a faculty affiliate of the Computational Science and Engineering program. I am a member of the Illinois Campus Research Board. Research InterestsApplied MathematicsDifferential Equations Fluid Dynamics Physical Oceanography Climate Science Research DescriptionMy research draws from rigorous analysis, numerical computationand modeling, to deepen our understanding of the mathematics of surface water waves and other related problems. They include physical oceanography and geophysical fluid dynamics. My projects emphasize large scale dynamics and genuinely nonlinear behaviors, such as breaking and peaking. Recently, I have interests in machine learning applications to other disciplines.
