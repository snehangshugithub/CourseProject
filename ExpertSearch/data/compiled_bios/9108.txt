He is the Director of the Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience at Waterloo, as well as the Canada Research Chair in Theoretical Neuroscience. The Centre focuses on mathematical characterizations of a variety neural systems, from individual ion channels to large-scale networks. Professor Eliasmith heads the Computational Neuroscience Research Group (CNRG), which is developing a framework for modelling the function of complex neural systems (the Neural Engineering Framework or NEF). The NEF is grounded in the principles of signal processing, control theory, statistical inference, and good engineering design, while providing a rational and robust strategy for simulating and evaluating a variety of biological neural circuit functions. Members of the group apply the NEF to projects characterizing sensory processing, motor control, and cognitive function. Work at the CNRG is divided into applications and theoretical development. Theoretical work includes extending the NEF to be more general (e.g. account for a wider range of single cell dynamics), more biologically plausible (e.g., capture network physiology and topology more precisely), and more adaptive (e.g., including better adaptive filtering, learning, etc.). The CNRG members are exploring general brain functions to explain not only how neural systems implement complex dynamics (the focus of the NEF), but also what neural systems are designed to do in general i.e., what the basic functional principles of the brain are. Regarding applications, the CNRG is building complex single cell networks to test hypotheses about the functioning of a given neural system as well as artificial intelligence and robotics applications. The simulation results are compared against available neural and behavioural data, and are then used to make novel predictions. CNRG members have constructed models of nonlinear adaptive arm control, working memory, locomotion, decision making, quadcopter control, the basal ganglia (implicated in Parkinsons Disease), rodent navigation, and language use. Professor Eliasmiths research team successfully built the worlds most complex simulation of the human brain Semantic Pointer Architecture Unified Network (SPAUN). SPAUN consists of 2.5 million simulated neurons, enabling it to perform 8 tasks such as copy drawing, counting, answering questions and fluid reasoning. It runs on a supercomputer, has a digital eye that is used for visual input and a robotic arm used for drawing its responses. Professor Eliasmith is the author of How to build a brain: A neural architecture for biological cognition and co-author of Neural Engineering: Computation, representation and dynamics in neurobiological systems.Research InterestsErgonomicsHuman Factors & BiomedicalModeling & SimulationPattern AnalysisMachine Intelligence & RoboticsSignal & Image ProcessingModeling the function of complex neural systemsTheoretical neuroscienceOperational Artificial IntelligenceRoboticsEducation2000, Doctorate, Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology Program, Washington University in St. Louis1995, Master's, M.A. Philosophy, University of Waterloo1994, Bachelor's, B.A.Sc.
