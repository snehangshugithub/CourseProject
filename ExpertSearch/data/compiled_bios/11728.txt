University of Waterloo, 2003M.S. University of Waterloo, 2006Ph.D. Duke University, 2012 "Our research makes an impact on the development of new injury mitigation technologies through the study the biomechanics of impact in sports, automotive crashes, and the military." Matthew B. Panzer, PhD Dr. Panzer is an Associate Professor of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering and Biomedical Engieering at the University of Virginia, and serves as Deputy Directorat the Center for Applied Biomechanics, and is a member of the UVA Brain Injury and Sports Concussion Center. He graduated from Duke University with a PhD in Biomedical Engineering, and from the University of Waterloo in Ontario Canada with this BS and MS in Mechanical Engineering. Dr. Panzer's research covers computational (primarily finite element simulation) and experimental (including post-mortem human subjects, animals, and volunteers) methods tostudy high-rate non-linear mechanics in the fields of tissue mechanics, impact biomechanics, vehicle crashworthiness, military blast and ballistics, and sports injury. Current applications of this research include the study of traumatic brain injury for blast, ballistic,and football helmet impacts, biological tissue testing and characterization, human body model development for automotive crashworthness (PI for two GHBMC Body Region Centers of Expertise) and blunt non-lethal weapons, and the development of injury mitigation systems such as helmets. Dr. Panzer has served as the Principal Investigator for more than 30 programs funded by various federal and industrial sponsors.
