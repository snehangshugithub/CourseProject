He has since applied comprehensive models for metal deformation that consider both kinetics and size effects to the study of polycrystalline metals (such as silver, aluminum alloys and steel) and copper-niobium nanoscale multilayers. This line of research has direct application to lightweighting automobiles and aerospace vehicles. More recently, he has extended the application of these models to crystallographic slip in ice. Working with researchers in France, he helped determine the effects of size on the dynamics of dislocations in ice single crystals.He has also used his computational methods to study the effects of deformation twinning on energy dissipation in high-rate deformed zirconium, the biomechanics of aggressive inline skating and dislocation nucleation, waves and partial continuity of the plastic strain rate.
