Her work in Operations Research includes applications of discrete optimization to network design, manufacturing design, scheduling, and location and layout. She developed algorithms (heuristic search and learning, and polynomial algorithms for special cases) for difficult decision problems arising in engineering and business areas. Skorin-Kapov is the author or the co-author of about 70 refereed publications in the field of Operations Research, and a recipient of a number of grants, including five National Science Foundation grants, a Fulbright award, and Ideas Worth Teaching Award from the Aspen Insitute. Skorin-Kapovs research in philosophy is in the area of Continental Philosophy, especially aesthetics and the phenomenology of surprise. The diversity of her academic interests has underlined her understanding of the notions of surprise and irreducible newness, presented in her book The Aesthetics of Desire and Surprise: Phenomenology and Speculation, (Lexington Books, 2015). The intertwining of aesthetics and ethics, relevant for contemporary business, is presented in her book The Intertwining of Aesthetics and Ethics: Exceeding of Expectations, Ecstasy, Sublimity, (Lexington Books, 2016). Skorin-Kapovs research in art history concerns the filmic art and her recent book is Darren Aronofsky's Films and the Fragility of Hope (Bloomsbury Academic, 2015). Skorin-Kapov integrated her research in business, philosophy, and art history in the book entitled Professional and Business Ethics through Film: The Allure of Cinematic Presentation and Critical Thinking (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018). This book on business ethics through film considers ethical issues arising in professional and business settings and the role of individuals making decisions and coping with moral dilemmas. Readers can benefit from engagement in filmic narratives, as a simulated environment for developing a stance towards ethical challenges.
