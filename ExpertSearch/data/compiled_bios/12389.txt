Sharp Institute Professor and Professor of Biology; Member, Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research Phillip A. Sharp studies many aspects of gene expression in mammalian cells, including transcription, the roles of non-coding RNAs, and RNA splicing. 617-253-6421 Phone 76-461A Office sharppa@mit.edu Email Lab Website Email Assistant 617-253-6425 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1969, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign BA, 1966, Chemistry and Math, Union College Research Summary We investigate small, non-coding RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate over half of the genes in mammalian cells at the stages of translation and mRNA stability. We are also interested in the processes underlying transcription from the anti-sense strand (so-called divergent transcription), as well as the relationship between elongation of transcription, RNA splicing, and chromatin modifications.
