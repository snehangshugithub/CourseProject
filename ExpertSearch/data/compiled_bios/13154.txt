She began her professional career at ExxonMobil Exploration as a geophysicist and then the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in the Earthquake Hazards division, Menlo Park, CA prior to joining the faculty at the University of Oklahoma in 2009. She was a GeoPRISMS Distinguished Lecturer from 2011-2013. Katie accepted a faculty position in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University in July of 2013. Keranen's research uses seismic reflection imaging, along with local and global seismicity, to study active fault zones and regions of active tectonics. She is interested in the role that fluids and sediment play in controlling seismogenesis.Research InterestsKeranen uses seismic methods to study faults, earthquakes, earth structure and deformation, and the role of fluids in deformation. Recent study areas for research and fieldwork include Chile, Ethiopia, offshore Oregon and Washington, Alaska, and Oklahoma. Keranen employs both active- and passive-source seismic methods, along with potential field methods, to image faults and lithospheric structure.Energy and the EnvironmentSustainable Energy SystemsGeophysics and SeismologyGeochemistry, Petrology and VolcanologyEnergy, Mineral and Water ResourcesTectonics and Structural GeologyTeaching InterestsGeophysical techniques and methods including raw data processing and interpretation from geophysical fieldwork; solid earth structure and active processes.Selected PublicationsBcel, A., D.J.
