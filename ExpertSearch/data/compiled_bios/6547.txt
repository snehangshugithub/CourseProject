Boeing Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics at the University of Washington that he joined as Assistant Professor in 2009.In 2004, he received the PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from the University of California, Irvine, where he continued his research as Postdoctoral Scholar until 2007. From 2007 to 2009, he was Postdoctoral Scholar in Aeronautics at the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT).Ferrante is recipient of theNSF CAREER Award(2011) for studying droplet-laden turbulence.Ferrante's computer visualizations ofcoherent structures in a turbulent boundary layerreceived the Best Video Award of the Gallery of Fluid Motion (2003) from the American Physical Society, Division of Fluid Dynamics.In 2019, he gave the keynote talk at ILASS 2019 entitled"Physical Mechanisms of Droplet/Turbulence Interaction"and a public talk at NASA Ames entitled"A Fast Pressure-Correction Method for Incompressible Flows Over Curved Walls."The results of his research have been presented in over one-hundred international conferences, contractor meetings, and invited talks in U.S., Europe and Asia. His scientific papers are published in premiere refereed journals such as Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Physics of Fluids, and Journal of Computational Physics.Ferrante's research and teaching interests are in the area of Computational Fluid Mechanics (CFM). His research is mainly focused on studying single-phase, multi-phase, and multi-species turbulent flows relevant to engineering applications, e.g., internal and external aerodynamics, propulsion, and to natural phenomena with the goal of helping the environment by reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. His research group develops numerical methods and algorithms for high-performance computing(HPC) to perform state-of-the-art Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of turbulent flows.
