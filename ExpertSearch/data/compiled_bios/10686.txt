Armentrout Professor Armentrout was born in Dayton, Ohio on March 13, 1953. He received a B.S. degree with highest honors in 1975 from Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio. While at Case, Prof. Armentrout conducted research with Prof. Rob Dunbar on photodissociation spectroscopy of molecular ions which led to his interest in ion-molecule chemistry. After bicycling to California during the summer of 1975, he joined Prof. Jack Beauchamp at Caltech where he was awarded the Blanche A. Mowrer Memorial Fellowship. At Caltech, he constructed an ion beam apparatus designed to study the hyperthermal reactivity of atomic uranium and other metal ions; work which comprised his Ph.D. thesis, awarded in 1980. That January, Prof. Armentrout became a postdoctoral member of staff at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, working with Dr. Robert S. Freund. There he studied electron impact ionization of metastable atoms and molecules. In July of 1981, Prof. Armentrout became an assistant professor at the University of California at Berkeley. He initiated a program which has come to study a wide spectrum of chemistries (primarily of transition metal species) by using ion-beam mass spectrometry. While at Berkeley, he was awarded a Camille and Henry Dreyfus Grant for Newly Appointed Faculty in Chemistry (1981), a NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award in its inception year (1984), and an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship (1986). In 1987, he joined the faculty at the University of Utah as an associate professor where he was awarded a Camille and Henry Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Grant (1987). In 1989, he was promoted to full professor. He has been recognized at Utah with an Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching Award from the Chemistry Department (1989) and the University-wide Distinguished Research Award (1994). He was the recipient of the Buck-Whitney Award from the American Chemical Society Eastern New York Section (1993) and in 1997, the graduate students at the Ohio State University Department of Chemistry selected Professor Armentrout as their Mack Memorial Award Lecturer. In 1998, he was promoted to Distinguished Professor of Chemistry and named Cannon Fellow in 2003. He received the Biemann Medal from the American Society of Mass Spectrometry in 2001, the Utah Award of Chemistry from the Utah Sections of the American Chemical Society in 2003, the Field and Franklin Award for Outstanding Achievement in Mass Spectrometry from the American Chemical Society in 2009, the Governor's Medal for Science and Technology Award from the State of Utah in 2010, and the Rosenblatt Prize for Excellence from the University of Utah in 2011. In 2011, his teaching was recognized by the R. W. Parry Teaching Award given by the Department of Chemistry, University of Utah. Professor Armentrout is a member of the editorial advisory boards of the Journal of the American Society of Mass Spectrometry and the International Journal of Mass Spectrometry and Ion Processes, and formerly of the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Journal of Physical Chemistry, Journal of Chemical Physics, Organometallics, and the Journal of Cluster Science (charter member). He is a member of the American Chemical Society, American Physical Society (fellow), American Society for Mass Spectrometry, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (fellow). He presently has nearly 500 research publications that have appeared in the literature. Thirty-six students have received their Ph.D.s with Professor Armentrout. In 1983, he married his high school sweetheart, Mary Ann White. They have three children, Matthew, Patricia, and Erin. Research Interests Our research provides a detailed understanding of the thermochemistry, kinetics, and dynamics of simple and complex chemical reactions. Our group seeks to understand, from a fundamental viewpoint, reactions involved in biological chemistry, catalysis, surface chemistry, organometallic chemistry, and plasma chemistry. Techniques involved include mass spectrometry, ion beams, molecular beams, laser spectroscopy, and ab initio theory. Chemistry of state-selected atomic metal ions. Transition metals have an abundance of low-lying electronic states that we have shown for 1st-row metals can have very different reactivity. We have recently developed a novel ion mobility source that should permit such studies to be extended to the 2nd- and 3rd- row metals where spin-orbit interactions become important. Chemistry of unsaturated organometallic complexes. By varying the number and types of ligands attached to metal ions, we study periodic trends, the influence of ligand substitution, and the effects of metal oxidation state on reactivity. These studies provide quantitative thermodynamic data and qualitative electronic information on unsaturated organometallic complexes: the key intermediates in homogeneous catalysis. Chemistry of solvated ions. Gas-phase solvated ions are important species in the atmosphere and in aerosols and provide a bridge between phenomena in condensed phases and the gas phase. Detailed experiments on such species yield quantitative information that cannot be obtained easily in the condensed phase. Thermochemistry of metal ions and protons interacting with biological molecules. Our work includes some of the first measurements of the binding energies of Li+, Na+ K+, and Rb+ with the nucleic acid bases, amino acids, and small peptides. The thermochemistry of protonated peptides is also being examined. Chemistry of metal cluster ions. Laser vaporization, supersonic expansion techniques generate cold transition metal cluster ions that can be size-selected using mass spectrometry. We measure the thermodynamic stabilities of these clusters and their reactivity with a variety of molecules. These studies provide quantitative data relevant to surface chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis. Environmental chemistry. A long standing interest has involved an investigation of the thermochemistry of systems having potential importance in the clean up of nuclear waste sites. Threshold behavior: theory and experiment. A theoretical understanding of the kinetic energy dependence of reaction cross sections is in its infancy. We are developing theoretical models that include application of statistical theories, reaction dynamics, and non-adiabatic effects. Ab initio theory. We consistently apply ab initio theory to provide structures, molecular parameters, and bond energies for use in the analysis and interpretation of our experimental results.
