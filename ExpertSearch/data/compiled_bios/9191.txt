In the six years before beginning his PhD program, he was engaged in research and development within the electronics industry. At Shell Oil Company, he helped develop CuS/CdS large-scale photovoltaic devices, concentrating on device modeling and processing to increase efficiency and reliability. He developed analytical models describing the material and device characteristics during Cu electromigration. This work led to a general theory of the phenomena and to processing solutions to the problem. At McDonnell Douglas (St. Louis, Mo.), he continued his work in photovoltaics in the development of HgCdTe IR detectors. These optoelectronic detectors were designed into focal plane arrays, thus creating a microelectronic imaging device. He holds a zero-time appointment as a Research Associate Professor in the Microelectronics Lab. Research Statement I have several areas of research which focus mainly on the basic materials processes such as nucleation and growth processes in metal/semiconductor systems. We work on problems which have a direct connection to microelectronics applications. Some examples include the following: Silicides for Silicon Source/Drain contacts Phys. Rev. B 49,13501-13511 (1994), Appl. Phys. Lett. 65, 561-563 (1994), J. Appl. Phys. 77, 4384-4388(1995), "Symposium for Microelectronic Silicides," MRS (1996). Ohmic contacts GaN [APL 64, pg.1003, 1994]; GaAs [APL. 51, pg. 326, 1987] Diffusion Barriers US Patent #5,023,201 (1991), US Patent #5,138,432 (1992), JAP, 79, 2446-2457 (1996), APL, 60 3179 (1996), Patent Filed #96-096, (1996).The second area of research involves the development of a new tool for materials studies: Nanocalorimetry Our group has invented a new Thin Film Scanning Calorimetry TDSC device. TDSC is the most sensitive scanning calorimetry device yet reported being 100-1000 times more sensitive than conventional systems. Our objective is to use the technique in two new areas: dynamic energy measurements at surfaces and sensor technology. The first steps toward these objectives have been extremely successful. Scanning Nano-Calorimetry Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) is a technique to measure heat exchange during chemical reactions or phase transformations. We have taken the old concept of scanning calorimetry and transformed it into a new powerful characterization/sensor device using micro-machining techniques. This has expanded DSC from traditional 3-D bulk systems to 2-D surface systems. Our TDSC is built upon the idea of the micro-heater, a thin strip of metal which we heat at extremely fast rates ~ 1,000,000 C/s by pulsing large currents through it. The TDSC is the most sensitive calorimetry system yet reported (0.2 nJ), capable of measuring the energy equivalent to melting 0.1 monolayer of atoms. Size-Dependent Melting Point We demonstrated the power of TDSC in our melting point study of Sn nanostructures. We are the first to show that both the melting point Tm and the heat of fusion Hm decrease when the physical size of the Sn structures decreases (<20nm). When 1 of Sn is deposited onto an inert substrate, the Sn atoms self-assemble into small islands (nanostructures) consisting of 1000 atoms. We found that these islands melt at Tm = 110C, far below the bulk value of 232C. At this stage, our TDSC technique is posed to answer key questions about the basic nature of the melting process, especially regarding surface pre-melting. Melting point depression of small particles has two strong implications for microelectronics technology: (i) control of crystallographic texture for metals during the early stages of film growth during island formation, and (ii) the stability/reliability of aluminum interconnect lines which will have dimensions of only 70 nm by the year 2002. Will these lines be solid or liquid at these dimensions?
