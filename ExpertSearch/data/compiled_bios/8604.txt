Background: Prof. Luos research interests include health/clinical informatics (data/predictive analytics and software system design/development), big data, machine learning, data mining, information retrieval, and database systems with a focus on health applications. He invented the first method for automatically providing rule-based explanations for any machine learning models prediction/classification results with no accuracy loss, the questionnaire-guided intelligent medical search engine iMed, intelligent personal health record, and SQL and compiler progress indicators. He received a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiaotong University, P.R. China, and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Between 2004 and 2012, he was a Research Staff Member at the IBM T.J. Watson research center. Between 2012 and 2016, he was a faculty member in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Utah. Teaching: Currently accepting new MS, PhD, and Post-doc students. Representative publications: G. Luo.
