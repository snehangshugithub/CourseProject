She obtained her Bachelor's Degree and Masters Degree in Civil Engineering from Chongqing University (China) and UB respectively. Dr. Yangs research focuses on highway bridge engineering, specifically regarding precast concrete bridges. She uses experimental and computational methods to investigate structural systems and materials that can reduce earthquake-induced damage to precast concrete bridges. Her research contributes to deploying accelerated bridge construction in seismic regions. Education B.Sc.
