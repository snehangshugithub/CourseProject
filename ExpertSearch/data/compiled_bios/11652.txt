His research expertise lies in heuristic optimization methods for environmental simulation model calibration, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis techniques for environmental simulation modelling, and watershed modelling of flow and nutrient transport. Dr. Tolsons research interests include discovering advanced methods for environmental simulation model development and subsequent use in environmental decision-making, environmental simulation models, parallel computing, soft computing, forecasting water levels, and optimizing water management policies. His current modelling case studies involve application to the SWAT2000, Watflood and Watclass models. To help fund his research, Dr. Tolson has received a NSERC Discovery Grant, IP3 collaborator grant, and an Environment Canada G&C Grant over time. He is affiliated with the American Geophysical Union, as well as the International Environmental Modelling and Software Society. Additionally, Dr. Tolson has published several articles and journals under the American Society of Civil Engineers.Research InterestsHydrologic model calibrationHydrologyWater resources planning and managementEnvironmental & Water ResourcesEnvironmental simulation model developmentEnvironmental decision-makingParallel computingMulti-objective optimizationSoft ComputingEducation2004, Doctorate, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Cornell University2000, Master of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, University of British Columbia1998, Bachelor of Applied Science, Environmental Science, University of GuelphCourses*CIVE 497 - Special Topics in Civil EngTaught in 2016CIVE 781 - Pr. of Hydrologic ModellingTaught in 2017ENVE 399 - SeminarTaught in 2016ENVE 400 - Environmental Eng DesProject 1Taught in 2016GEOE 399 - SeminarTaught in 2016GEOE 400 - Geological Eng Design Proj 1Taught in 2016* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsTolson, Bryan and Craig, James, A new fit-for-purpose model testing framework: Decision Crash Tests, , 2016Shafii, Mahyar and Tolson, Bryan and Matott, L Shawn, Improving the efficiency of Monte Carlo Bayesian calibration of hydrologic models via model pre-emption, Journal of Hydroinformatics, 17(5), 2015, 763 - 770Khedr, Ayman and Tolson, Bryan, Comparing optimization techniques with an engineering judgment approach to WDN design, Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management, 142(5), 2015Haghnegahdar, Amin and Tolson, Bryan A and Craig, James R and Paya, Karol T, Assessing the performance of a semi-distributed hydrological model under various watershed discretization schemes, Hydrological Processes, 29(18), 2015, 4018 - 4031Xu, Xiaoyong and Tolson, Bryan A and Li, Jonathan and Staebler, Ralf M and Seglenieks, Frank and Haghnegahdar, Amin and Davison, Bruce, Assimilation of SMOS soil moisture over the Great Lakes basin, Remote Sensing of Environment, 169, 2015, 163 - 175Graduate StudiesCurrently considering applications from graduate students.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
