My broad research interests areDistributed Systems,Cloud Computing, Elasticity, andMachine Learning. More specifically, I work on the related problems in Auto-Scalingof large-scale systems in the Cloud. Currently, I am doing an internship at Bell Labs in Dublin/Ireland. During my internship, I am working on a novel solution for application agnostic auto-scaling using Reinforcement Learning.In my former project, I worked on a novel functional model forconfiguration management (CM)as we auto-scale systems. ResearchProjects I am the founder of the Karamel, an open-source project for cloud-based provisioning of large-scale distributed systems. In addition to the engine, we have developedother sub-modules for Karamel that are open-sourced too. HoneyTapis Karamel's auto-scaling system, TableSpoonis a distributed monitoring system for resource utilization, Kandyis a system for provisioning of transient servers for maximizing the reliability. Earlier in my master thesis, I had worked on a projectfor scaling out the Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS). My contribution to that work is the hierarchical and pessimisticrow level concurrency control for maintainingthe metadata consistency(source code, publication). This work is continued by other students and it is called HopsFS for improving the performance. (source code, publication) Teaching Since the start of myPh.D., I have assisted in designing homework, labs,tutorials and also helping students for the following courses in ourdepartment.
