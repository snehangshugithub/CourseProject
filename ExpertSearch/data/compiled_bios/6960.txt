We are a group of evolutionary biologists in the Department of Biology &Burke Museum studying the diversity and systematics of reptiles and amphibians. Our research is focused on topics including phylogenetics and species tree inference, statistical phylogeography, species delimitation, and comparative biology. We utilize molecular genetic data to estimate phylogenetic relationships and infer current and historical population processes. Our research is collections-based, and takes us to places including Western North America, South America, Mexico & West Africa.We are also actively exploring creative new ways to apply genomic datainto our studies, and this keeps us engaged in bioinformatics. We are always looking for talented undergraduate researchers, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers to join the lab. If you are interested in joining, please contact us via email for more information on how to apply. Google ScholariNaturalist Comments are closed. Powered by Nirvana & WordPress.
