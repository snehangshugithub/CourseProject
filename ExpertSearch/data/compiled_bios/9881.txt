His research interests are in the areas of semiconductor device characterization, design, and simulation, as well as signal integrity. He helped establish a THz measurement facility at PSU and is pursuing research in THz applications, including the development of novel sensors that integrate THz and nano-material technologies. More recently, he is involved in the design and characterization of EM absorbing materials and ferroelectric devices. He is also conducting research in engineering education at both undergraduate and graduate levels. He was a Technical Program Committee co-chair for two conferences: International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems (ICECS) 2002 and MELECON 2004, as well as a guest editor for special issues of Analog Integrated Circuits And Signal Processing journal and Telecommunication Systems Journal. Professor Pejinovi is a Senior Member of IEEE, and Member of American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE). A selection of his recent awards includes: 1. Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute (ONAMI), "THz Detection and Sensing Using Nanostructures," 2009-2011, PI (co-PIs: L. Zurk, J. Jiao, R. Koenenkamp, R. Campbell) 2. Nacionalna zaklada za znanost Republike Hrvatske, (National science foundation of the Republic of Croatia), "Measurement and Modeling of Signal Integrity in Mixed-mode Circuits," 2007, PI (co-PI: A. Baric) 3. Tektronix Foundation, PSU, Tektronix, Sharp Microelectronics, Cascade Microtech, "High-Frequency Design and Measurement Lab" (part of "IC Design and Test Lab"). PI (co-PI: R. Daasch). Research Interest and Expertise: THz material characterization Semiconductor device characterization from DC to THz Device design and simulation (including SiGe BJTs, GaAs FETs, strained-SOI CMOS, low-bandgap FETs, avalanche photodetectors, and ferroelectric devices) Signal integrity Undergraduate and Graduate education Courses Taught: ECE 101 Exploring Electrical Engineering ECE 211/212 Introduction to Design Processes + Introduction to Project Development ECE 424 Engineering Professional Practice ECE 431/2 & 531/2 Microwave Circuit Design I and II ECE 511 Solid-state Electronics I Links to Research Archives: PDX Scholar Google Scholar Research Gate Electrical and Computer Engineering Maseeh College of Engineering & Computer Science Follow Me Twitter Facebook Education M.S. in Electrical and Computer EngineeringUniversity of Massachusetts, Amherst Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer EngineeringUniversity of Massachusetts, Amherst, Dipl.
