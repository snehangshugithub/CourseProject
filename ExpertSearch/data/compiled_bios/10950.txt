Rena Zieve Group Home Research Teaching Contact REU Professor Zieve is a condensed matter experimentalist who has been at UC Davis since 1996. She is presently Chair of the Physics Department. She initiated the summer Research Experience for Undergraduates Program, ran it for many years, and remains very much involved. As of Fall 2020 she has space for new undergraduate students for computational and design projects. Laboratory access is limited, and hands-on projects for undergraduates will wait until that changes. Copyright@2012 UC Davis and Rena Zieve Group
