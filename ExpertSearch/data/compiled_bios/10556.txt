His lab works at the interface of Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. Current efforts in the lab are directed towards understanding how biomolecular condensates form and regulate processes such as transcription. For this purpose, the lab develops new tools for quantitative super resolution imaging of DNA, RNA, and proteins; and combines them with quantitative live cell imaging, cell line engineering, in vitro reconstitution, and computational modeling.
