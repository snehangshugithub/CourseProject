Currently, my work focuses on the interplay between geometric group theory and number theory: I study arithmetic properties of integer matrix groups such as various monodromy groups and hyperbolic reflection groups. This usually involves combining arithmetic tools with the geometry inherent to these groups. More recently these interests have led me to investigate how generic certain properties of such groups are.
