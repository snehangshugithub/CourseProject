Aerospace Engineering, University of VirginiaPh.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering: Fluid Dynamics, Princeton University Asst. Professor Quinn first came to the University of Virginia as an undergraduate student in 2006. After graduating with a BS in Aerospace Engineering, he attended Princeton University and completed a PhD in the Hydrodynamics Lab working on bio-inspired propulsion with Professor Lex Smits. While at Princeton, Quinn was also a Visiting Fellow at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. For his doctoral work, Professor Quinn was awarded the American Physical Societys Andreas Acrivos Dissertation Award in Fluid Dynamics. He went on to become a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Bio-Inspired Research and Design group at Stanford University, studying the stability characteristics of birds flying in turbulent gusts. Professor Quinn joined the UVA faculty in 2017. He is a member of the Link Lab, a group of researchers studying Cyber-Physical Systems---particularlyautonomous vehicles, body sensor networks, and smart homes.

Assistant professor Dan Quinn's op-ed reveals how his new research could inspire new designs for submarines and airplanes. Read More Popular Science: UVA Robot Tuna Inspired by Real Fish Popular Science: UVA Robot Tuna Inspired by Real Fish It looks like a fish and swims like a fish, but its also a model that could inspire future underwater vehicles. Read More A Robotic Fish Tail and an Elegant Math Ratio Could Inform the Design of Next-Generation Underwater Drones A Robotic Fish Tail and an Elegant Math Ratio Could Inform the Design of Next-Generation Underwater Drones University of Virginia School of Engineering researchers uncover the secrets of highly efficient swimming at varying speeds. Read More New Atlas: Robotic tuna uses variable-stiffness tail for more efficient swimming New Atlas: Robotic tuna uses variable-stiffness tail for more efficient swimming Fish are thought to adjusttheir tail stiffness to swim efficiently over a wide range of speeds, buthow they tune stiffness has been a mystery. Quinn and his colleagues derived a model thatuncovers a piece of the mystery: muscle tension should scale with swimming speed squared. By applying their strategy to a fish-like robot, they were able to nearly double its efficiency.
