We integrate approaches from physiological ecology and evolution, population and community ecology, and biogeography. While we continue some work on lizards, our research focus has been shifting toward montane butterflies and grasshoppers in Colorado as they offer excellent historical records. These projects are part of an initiativeto develop computational and visualization tools to translate climate change into biological responses. Questions weve worked on recently include: How does local adaptation across a species range influence responses to climate change? How does thermoregulatory behavior alter the evolution of thermal tolerances and climate change impacts over the short and long term? How does thermal exposure and sensitivity vary across the life cycle and what are the implications for demography and distributions? What are the implications of developmental plasticity for phenology and demography in changing environments? What are the relative impacts of acute (extremes) and chronic (means) climate conditions on demography and distributions? How does climate variability influence plastic and evolutionary responses to climate change? Lauren Buckley's research is focused on improving forecast of ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change.She majored in Biology and Math as an undergrad at Williams College,conducted graduate research in Biologyat Stanford University, and held postdoctoral fellowships at the National Center For Ecological Analysis and Synthesisand the Santa Fe Institute. She has been recognized as an NSF CAREER awardee, a National Academy of Sciences Kavli Frontiers of Science Fellow, and a Future Leader at the Science and Technology in Society Forum.
