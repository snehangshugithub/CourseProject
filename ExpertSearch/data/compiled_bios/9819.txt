Virginia Commonwealth University B.A. Houghton College Areas of Expertise Combinatorics Graph Theory Discrete Mathematical Biology Background My research is in discrete mathematics. I am particularly intrigued by problems that have application to or are motivated by biological structures, such as genome rearrangement. The combinatorics of partially ordered sets is another theme in my research, including dimension and saturation. I am excited to supervise student research in these or other areas of discrete mathematics. I joined the Mathematics and Computer Science Department following a three-year postdoctoral engagement at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
