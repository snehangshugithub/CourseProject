Chemistry, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY About Nancy Professor Savage joined the University of New Haven in 2005. She received her Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY and attended the graduate program in Chemistry at The Ohio State University, where she investigated materials as high-temperature, harsh-condition gas sensors. Dr. Savage was the recipient of a National Research Council (NRC) postodoctoral fellowship, which supported her work at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD. At NIST, she developed a methodology for integrating sol-gel materials with micro-machined sensing platforms. She recently spent a sabbatical semester at the University of Connecticut synthesizing and characterizing mesoporous materials for catalytic applications. Dr. Savages research interests are within the broad area of materials chemistry. She continues to investigate new materials for chemical sensing applications, particularly composites of metal oxides with conducting polymers. Additionally, she is interested in applications for materials prepared using the electrospinning method, such as analytical separations. During her time at the University of New Haven, Dr. Savage has mentored numerous undergraduate students for summer research and thesis projects.
