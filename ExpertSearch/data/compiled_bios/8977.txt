Silevitch received the BSEE, MSEE, and PhD from Northeastern University in 1965, 1966, and 1971, respectively. He joined the faculty of Northeastern in 1972, and was appointed to the Robert D. Black Endowed Chair in Engineering at Northeastern in 2003, the same year that he was elected an IEEE Fellow for leadership in advanced subsurface sensing and imaging techniques. A College of Engineering distinguished professor with dual appointments in Electrical and Computer Engineering as well as Civil and Environmental Engineering, Silevitch is director of Awareness and Localization of Explosives-Related Threats (ALERT), a Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence; director of the Bernard M. Gordon Center for Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems (Gordon-CenSSIS), a National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center; and research translation leader of the Puerto Rico Testsite to Explore Contamination Threats (PROTECT) program, funded through the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Previously, Dr. Silevitch directed the Center for Electromagnetics Research, an NSF Industry-University Center, and the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program, a graduate program that provides an innovative model for training engineering leaders.Dr. Silevitch has also contributed his efforts toward improving the education of young scientists and engineers. From 1987-1996, he served as the director of the Center for the Enhancement of Science and Mathematics Education (CESAME), funded by grants from NSF and the Noyce Foundation, which developed a systematic mechanism to implement a statewide network of exemplary K-12 mathematics and science curricula, and as principal investigator for IMPACT, a $5 million grant from NSF that resulted in the implementation of exemplary curricula in 500 school districts throughout the New England region. He also served as one of the Co-PIs on the $20 Million NSF-funded 10 year (1990-2000) Massachusetts Statewide Systemic Initiative Project, PALMS (Partnerships Advancing the Learning of Mathematics and Science). The PI of PALMS was the Massachusetts Commissioner of Education.Dr. Silevitchs other accomplishments include leading a university-industry team on a $4.7M, 2-year DHS-funded effort to demonstrate new detectors and imaging algorithms for a nuclear material detection tool, ASHERD, enabling rapid inspection of cargo containers and vehicles. After successful testing, Silevitch provided guidance for a large DHS industrial contract on an Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP), a $400M production program led by Raytheon that was based on the ASHERD system. ASP units are presently in use in the NY Container Terminal. In Dr. Silevitchs professional area of expertise, space plasma physics, he served as principal investigator for multiple Air Force-funded projects, focusing on problems such as the structure of the earths radiation belts, the formation of the aurora borealis and the nature of wave-particle interaction in space plasma.Dr. Silevitch has authored over 65 publications and 90 presented papers spanning several research disciplines including collaborations with scientists from the United States, France, Sweden, Finland and Austria.EducationObtained his BSEE, MSEE, and PhD from Northeastern University in 1965, 1966, and 1971.Honors & AwardsLife Fellow, Institute of Electrical and Electronics EngineersNational Academy of Engineering Gordon Prize for developing an innovative method to provide graduate engineers with the necessary personal skills to become effective engineers Toggle Accordion Research Research OverviewSubsurface sensing and imaging systems, detection of explosives-related anomalies, engineered system development and engineering leadershipSelected Research ProjectsEngineering PLUS (Partnerships Launching Underrepresented Students) Alliance Co-Principal Investigator, National Science FoundationALERT: Awareness and Localization of Explosives Related Threats, A Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence.

Black Distinguished Professor of ECE, has been awarded $36 million over 10 years to lead a new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) multi-institutional Center of Excellence, SENTRY (Soft target Engineering to Neutralize the Threat RealitY). SENTRY will develop a Virtual Sentry system that provides just-in-time information to key decision makers to protect civilian soft targets such as transit stations and schools, and crowded spaces such as stadiums from covert threats. FacultyAug 11, 2021Northeastern Wins $10 Million NSF Grant to Boost People of Color and Women in Engineering NationallyNortheasterns College of Engineering won a prestigious NSF $10 million five-year grant, Engineering PLUS (Partnerships Launching Underrepresented Students) Alliance, to build a system and a network to increase engineering degrees among women and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and Other People of Color) nationally. Karl Reid, Northeastern Universitys Chief Diversity Office, is PI, and Michael Silevitch, College of Engineering Distinguished Professor, ECE, Claire Duggan, director of STEM programs and operations, COE, and Richard Harris, assistant dean for Academic Scholarship, Mentoring, and Outreach and director of NU Program in Multicultural Engineering, COE, are co-PIs, as well as Karen Horting of the Society of Women Engineers. FacultyApr 16, 2021Silevitch to Direct New AI Jumpstart ProgramECE Professor Michael Silevitch will lead a new Massachusetts program,AI Jumpstart, to connect small business owners in the state with academic faculty experts to learn how machine learning can grow their companies. Northeastern received a $2.2 million state grant that will be used primarily for high-speed computer equipment and also to provide for faculty consultants, both of which will be available to selected companies to get the pilot effort up and running. Northeastern kicked in an additional $2 million, raising the programs total value to more than $4 million. Mar 12, 2020Northeastern Spearheading Advances in Travel SafetyNortheasterns ALERT(Awareness and Localization of Explosives-Related Threats)is one of nine Department of Homeland (DHS) Security Centers of Excellence (COEs) located across the country. A multi-university center, ALERT conducts research and development for effective responses to explosives-related threats. ALERT is funded by a core grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate that equates to roughly $3.6 million a year. In addition to the Centers ongoing core research award, DHS also provides each COE with an ability to obtain task order contracts targeted to develop specific security technologies and methods.
