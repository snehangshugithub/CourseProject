My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and data systems and my students are working on a wide range of projects including: real-time model serving; machine learning life-cycle management; accelerated deep learning for computer vision; new cryptographic primitives for federated learning; frameworks for deep reinforcement learning and parameter tuning; model based cloud resource management; software platforms for autonomous vehicles research; computational efficient representations for asynchronous time series; smf frameworks for graph query processing.Co-founder: I am also co-founder of Turi Inc. (formerly GraphLab), which was originally based on my thesis work on the GraphLab and PowerGraph Systems. Turi was recently acquired by Apple Inc.Background: Before joining UC Berkeley as an assistant professor, I was a post-doc in the UC Berkeley AMPLab working on several projects including GraphX (now part of Apache Spark), early versions of MLbase, Velox, and concurrency control for ML. I obtained my PhD from the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University where I worked with on Parallel and Distributed Systems for Probabilistic Reasoning.
