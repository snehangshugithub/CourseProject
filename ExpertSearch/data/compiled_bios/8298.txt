Grafton and Lillian B. Wilkins Professor, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, UIUC, 1998-2002 Professor, Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, UIUC, Aug. 1989-date Associate Professor, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, UIUC, 1983-1989 Assistant Professor, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, UIUC, 1978-83 Major Consulting Activities Cerus Corporation, Concord, CA, 2002 Husch & Eppenberger, Peoria, IL, 2001-03 Kenyon & Kenyon, New York, NY, 2001-04 Research Statement Professor Tucker has had a major impact on engineering practice by developing models and methods to predict fiber orientation patterns in injection-molded composite parts. Flow during mold filling imparts a pattern of preferential orientation to these fibers, which in turn controls the mechanical properties of the molded part. Professor Tucker developed a governing equation for flow-induced fiber orientation and introduced the use of tensor moment equations to create a model that can be solved with a practical amount of computer time. The resulting model has been adopted by every commercial software program for injection molding, and is used worldwide hundreds of times each day to predict the fiber orientation pattern and mechanical properties of molded parts.Professor Tucker has a long record of original research contributions related to manufacturing processes for polymers and composite materials. In addition to his model for fiber orientation, he developed some of the first computer simulations of mold filling for compression and liquid composite molding. He pioneered the use of analytical sensitivity methods for optimal design of extrusion dies and injection molds. He showed that thermal dispersion was a significant effect in liquid composite molding and showed how to model it. He also applied these techniques to compute optimal curing cycles for thermoset-matrix composites. He developed a technique, now patented, for controlling the orientation of carbon fibers to enhance the electrical conductivity of fuel cell separator plates. He introduced computationally-efficient models for droplet deformation in polymer blends, based on Eshelby's inclusion theory, and used these models to show that droplet stretching statistics follows certain universal rules in chaotic mixing flows.
