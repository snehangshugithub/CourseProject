Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview My research program uses neuroanatomical, experimental lesion, optogenetic, and electrophysiological approaches to examine the contribution of brain regions adjacent to the hippocampus (including the perirhinal, postrhinal/parahippocampal, and entorhinal cortices) to memory and to other higher cognitive functions. Research Statement For decades the hippocampus has been the focus of research on the neural basis of memory. Studies conducted over the last few years have provided evidence that cortical areas surrounding the hippocampus contribute to some forms of memory. Given the long-standing concept that the hippocampus serves a critical role in memory processes, the finding that some memory tasks are sensitive to lesions of these adjacent cortical regions, alone, has highlighted the need for close examination of the function of those adjacent structures. My research program uses neuroanatomical, experimental lesion, and electrophysiological approaches to examine the contribution of these regions, including the perirhinal, postrhinal/parahippocampal, and entorhinal cortices, to memory and to other higher cognitive functions. Among other approaches, we employ single-unit recording in behaving animals to examine neuronal firing correlates of behavioral events in tasks that tap such functions as spatial memory, recognition memory, configuration of multiple stimuli, attentional processes, and the processing of context. These approaches are used to differentiate the function of these cortical regions from each other and from those of the hippocampus.

Brown University, 1996-2001 Teaching Teaching Overview My teaching interests are in the theory, history, literature, and techniques of behavioral neuroscience, particularly the areas if memory and attention. I am also interested in increasing the numbers of individuals who are underrepresented in the field of neuroscience through teaching and mentoring. Recently I have become interesting in blended learning. I "flipped" my course, Memory and the Brain. Students acquire content on their own through readings and my online lectures. Class comprises activities designed to increase mastery of the material as well as skills in reading, discussing, and presenting science.
