My primary education interests focus on student achievement and ways to disrupt educational inequities in science. My primary ecological interests revolve around species interactions and the impacts we can expect from anthropogenic global changes. 2020 - present; Assistant Teaching Professor, University of Washington, Biology 2016 - 2020 Postdoc, University of Washington, Biology - Advisor: Scott Freeman and Alison Crowe 2016PhD,University of Washington, Biology - Advisor: Janneke HilleRisLambers 2009MA Ed, Alliant International University 2006 - 2010Middle school and High school Science Teacher, Oakland, CA 2005BA in Biology, Colby College, Maine Elli Theobald interviewed in UW News on active learning Policy Forum piece in Science Active learning research article honored in Altmetric's 2020 Top 100 OpEd by Scott Freeman and Elli Theobald on Inside Higher Ed Active learning:Hands-on meets minds-on, Yannier, Nesra, Hudson Scott E., Koedinger Kenneth R., Hirsh-Pasek Kathy, Golinkoff Roberta Michnick, Munakata Yuko, Doebel Sabine, Schwartz Daniel L., Deslauriers Louis, McCarty Logan, et al. , Science, Volume 374, p.2630, (2021) Climate change impacts on natural icons: Do phenological shifts threaten the relationship between peak wildflowers and visitor satisfaction?, Lambers, Janneke Hille Ris, Cannistra Anthony F., John Aji, Lia Emmi, Manzanedo Rubn D., Sethi Meera, Sevigny Jordana, Theobald Elli J., and Waugh Jazzmine K. , Climate Change Ecology, Volume 2, p.100008, (2021) Active learning narrows achievement gaps for underrepresented students in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and math, Theobald, Elli J., Hill Mariah J., Tran Elisa, Agrawal Sweta, E Arroyo Nicole, Behling Shawn, Chambwe Nyasha, Cintrn Dianne Laboy, Cooper Jacob D., Dunster Gideon, et al. , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 117, p.64766483, (2020) Student perception of group dynamics predicts individual performance: Comfort and equity matter, Theobald, Elli J., Eddy Sarah L., Grunspan Daniel Z., Wiggins Benjamin L., and Crowe Alison J. , PloS one, Volume 12, p.e0181336, (2017) Global change and local solutions: Tapping the unrealized potential of citizen science for biodiversity research, Theobald, Ellinore J., Ettinger Ailene K., Burgess Hillary K., DeBey Lauren B., Schmidt Natalie R., Froehlich Halley E., Wagner Christian, HilleRisLambers Janneke, Tewksbury Joshua, Harsch Melanie A., et al. , Biological Conservation, Volume 181, p.236244, (2015) How will biotic interactions influence climate changeinduced range shifts?, HilleRisLambers, Janneke, Harsch Melanie A., Ettinger Ailene K., Ford Kevin R., and Theobald Elinore J. , Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, Volume 1297, p.112125, (2013) Main menu PeopleFacultyGraduate StudentsPostdocsStaffResearchGrad SpotlightFields of InterestUndergraduate OpportunitiesPrograms & CoursesUndergraduateAdmissionsAcademic ResourcesAdvisingAwards & ScholarshipsHonorsIntroductory CoursesInternshipsPeer facilitatorsRegistrationResearch OpportunitiesGraduateAwards & FellowshipsPh.D ProgramAdmissionsFAQGuidelinesLab RotationsFundingStudent LifeGrad TravelPostdoctoral FellowsPostdoc FAQRelated ProgramsUWINNeurobiologyCollege of the EnvironmentMicrobiologyCoursesFacilitiesLife Sciences ComplexGreenhouseResearchTeachingSupportContactResearchBackup FreezersImagingContactEquipmentInformationLocationPolicyRatesScheduleLearningBiology Study AreaTri-Beta AssistancePartnersBurke MuseumFriday Harbor LabsHerbariumNews & EventsCOVID-19 informationRecent NewsEventsSeminarsAutumnWinterSpringNewslettersBlogsMedicinal Herb GardenNature's DepthsSciPosAbout usSupport UW BiologyDiversity in BiologyDept Culture Office HourDiversity and Equity CommitteeResourcesJoin UW BiologyContact usDepartmental committeesMentoring resourcesVirtual tourLogin UW Home Directories Libraries Maps My UW 2016 University of Washington Department of Biology / Seattle, Washington /Privacy/ Terms of Use
