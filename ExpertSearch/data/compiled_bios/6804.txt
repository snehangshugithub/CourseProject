At a billionth of a degree above absolute zero, laser-cooled and trapped gases of neutral atoms are among the coldest objects in the universe. We employ thesequantum gases as versatile simulationtestbeds and sensorsfor exploring novel quantum matter and their applications. Our recentprojectsfocus on: Quantum neural network computing and quantum spin glassusing quantum gasmultimode cavity QED -The first optical lattice with sound has been created, opening up new avenues for quantum simulation -We have theoritically descibed how aconfocal cavity QED neural networkcan enhanceassociative memory recall and storage capacity -We realized a versatile set of novelphoton-mediated interactions among atoms and dynamical spin-orbit coupling -Read more about theconfocal cavity QED neural networkandoptical lattices with phonon modesin Nature. 1D dipolar quantum gases of the most magnetic atom, dysprosium, to studyquantum nonequilibrium physics -We discovered novelquantum many-body scar states and made adipolar quantum Newtons cradle -Read more about ourquantum many-body scar statesin Science and thedipolar quantum Newtons cradle.
