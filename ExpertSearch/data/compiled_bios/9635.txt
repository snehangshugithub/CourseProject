Langer 70 Family and Friends Professor Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering sj19@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyShaoyi Jiang joined the Meinig School as Robert S. Langer 70 Family and Friends Professor in June 2020. Prior to Cornell he was the Boeing-Roundhill Professor of Engineering in the Department of Chemical Engineering and an adjunct professor of Bioengineering at the University of Washington, Seattle.Jiangs research focuses on the molecular understanding, design and development of functional zwitterionic materials for biomedical and engineering applications. Since the early 2000s, his group has proposed the concept of super-hydrophilic zwitterionic materials, provided a molecular-level understanding of non-fouling mechanisms and developed several new classes of zwitterionic materials, including poly(carboxybetaine), poly(sulfobetaine), poly(trimethylamine N-oxide), poly(zwitterionic phosphatidylserine), and glutamic acid (E) and lysine (K)-containing poly(peptides). While the super-hydrophilic properties of zwitterionic materials are responsible for their excellent biocompatibility, the amphiphilic properties of their poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) counterparts are the origin of their immunogenicity. His group has demonstrated no capsule formation upon subcutaneous implantation in mice for one year, expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) without differentiation, no anti-coagulants needed for artificial lungs in sheep, no antibodies generated against zwitterionic polymers and long-lasting marine coatings.At Cornell, his group aims to (a) integrate immunology into existing biomaterials research programs to develop immune-modulating biomaterials, assisted by a fundamental understanding at the molecular and cellular levels and artificial intelligence-directed materials discovery; (b) translate his biomaterials technologies into medical and engineering practice in nanomedicine/drug delivery/ cancer immune therapeutics, regenerative medicine/tissue engineering/stem cells, medical devices and marine coatings. His group has close collaborations with researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering, Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell Center for Immunology and several academic departments at Cornell.Jiang's lab currently has multiple postdoctoral positions available.Research InterestsBiomedical EngineeringBiomolecular EngineeringColloids and Interfacial ScienceDrug Delivery and NanomedicineMaterials DesignMaterials Synthesis and ProcessingMolecular and Cellular EngineeringMolecular BiotechnologyNanobio ApplicationsNanotechnologyPolymers and Soft MatterStatistical Mechanics and Molecular SimulationTissue Engineering and BiomaterialsTeaching InterestsBiomaterialsBiointerfacesDrug Delivery and NanomedicineImmunoengineeringBiomolecular ThermodynamicsIntroduction to Molecular Modeling and Simulation MethodsSelected PublicationsT.
