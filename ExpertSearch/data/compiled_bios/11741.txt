Allen Bio B.S.E. Duke University, 1999M.S. University of California, San Diego, 2001Ph.D. University of California, San Diego, 2006 "My teaching is focused on providing students with the practical experience needed to engage in research and design that spans the breadth of BME." Timothy E. Allen, Professor Timothy E. Allen teaches and mentors students in the areas of computational modeling of complex biological systems, molecular and cell biology assays, and medical device design. He is aProfessor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia. He received a B.S.E. in Biomedical Engineering at Duke University and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Bioengineering at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Allen's teaching activities include coordinating the undergraduate teaching labs and the Capstone Design sequence in the BME department at the University of Virginia, and his research interests are in the fields of computational biology and bioinformatics. He is also interested in evaluating the pedagogical approaches optimal for teaching lab concepts and skills, computational modeling approaches, and professionalism within design classes. He is active within the Biomedical Engineering Division of the American Society for Engineering Education and previously served on the executive committee of this division (Program Chair 2011, Division Chair 2012, & Nominating Committee Chair 2013). Dr. Allen serves on the BMES Education Committee. Heis also the PI on a newly renewed NSF REU site focused on multi-scale systems bioengineering and biomedical data sciences, a collaboration involving faculty in SEAS, SOM, SDS,and CLAS at U.Va., as well as six partner institutions in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast.

Advances in the biomedical sciences and medicine will increasingly depend upon the application of rigorous and quantitative engineering-based approaches to characterize and interrogate biological systems. This REU Site in Multi-Scale Systems Bioengineering and Biomedical Data Sciences at the University of Virginia will train ten undergraduate participants per summer in state-of-the-art systems bioengineering and data science research. While open to a broad national pool of top students in STEM, the REU Site will specifically target talented UGs majoring in STEM fields at institutions with limited research opportunities in the field of systems bioengineering and biomedical data science, with an emphasis on recruiting students from underrepresented groups. The research experience and mentorship these REU students will prepare them for work in this fast-growing and pioneering field that would otherwise be unavailable to them at their home institutions. Faculty mentors will maintain continuing relationships with the participants after completing the program, helping to improve the likelihood that the students will remain in STEM.
