Our research is motivated by the notion that complex behaviors in bacteria (e.g. pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance, gene regulation and cell-fate decisions, etc.) often arise from cell-to-cell variability, transient cellular dynamics, or heterogeneous phenotypic responses before spreading within a population. Consequently, to gain sufficient insight into active biological processes, information about microorganisms must be gathered at the single-cell level and in real time.To this end, we combine tools from Physics, Bioengineering, and Synthetic Biology to monitor the response of individual bacteria subjected to environmental fluctuations. We believe that the study of naturally-occurring regulatory systems can lead to the discovery of physical and biological principles broadly applicable to the development of biomedical and diagnostics applications. Ongoing research projects include the study of the survival strategies used by bacteria in response to toxic environments, a quantitative description of synthetic transcription factors and their robustness to perturbations, and the basis of extracellular information processing in microorganisms.We also aim to utilize the insights gained from the study of complex biological systems to aid the design of new tools for applications in biotechnology and medicine. For instance, by seeking to understand the selective pressures guiding the evolution of antibiotic resistance, our efforts may contribute to the development of new and more efficient antimicrobials. Beyond that, the Lambert Lab is also interested in the development and characterization of synthetic biological regulatory elements to guide the creation of biological circuits in cells and other active living systems.BioengineeringBiotechnologyImage AnalysisImaging and InstrumentationMolecular and Cellular EngineeringMolecular BiotechnologyMicrofluidicsMicrofluidics and MicrosystemsNanobio ApplicationsSystems and Synthetic BiologyBiophysicsSelected PublicationsLambert, Guillaume, Justin Chew, Michael J.
