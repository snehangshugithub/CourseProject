Iwork closely with animal neurophysiologist and clinicianstodevelop data constrained neuralmodels that are functionally and translationally relevant. A main theme of mylab's research is todevelop biophysically principled models of neural circuits thatbridge the critical gap between human brain imaging signals (MEG/EEG) and their underlying cellular and network level generators. Current projects apply such interdisciplinarytechniques to study the mechanisms and functionsof neural dynamics, includingbrain rhythms,in healthy functions such asperception,attention and decision making, and inneural pathologies such as Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. We alsostudy the impact ofbrain stimulation (DBS, tACS, TMS), and mind-body practices, on braindynamics with an ultimategoal of improvingtreatments for neuropatholgy.
