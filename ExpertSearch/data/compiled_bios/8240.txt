Faculty and Staff Development UW Bothell provides a range of opportunities for faculty and staff to co-learn and engage with experts in specific areas of teaching and learning praxis. Opportunities of particular note: Equity Across the Curriculum How can UW Bothell foster a community of learners ready to imagine another world, one that advances UW Bothells goal to strengthen diversity, equity, and inclusion? The Equity Across the Curriculum Initiative explores this question as it relates to liberatory pedagogy and faculty development. It is a peer-to-peer faculty development project co-sponsored by the Office of Academic Affairs, the Learning and Teaching Collaborative and the Office of Diversity and Equity. Campus-Wide Initiative Project for Marginalized Faculty Recognizing that specific members of our UW Bothell community are disproportionately affected by systemic bias and inequities that affect their mental wellness, sense of belonging and their ability to thrive as academics, Drs. Thelma Madzima and Rebecca Price have created a Campus-wide Initiative Project that began Autumn 2020 and runs through the Fall 2022quarter. General Faculty Organization The General Faculty Organization (GFO) serves as the forum for faculty deliberation and decision-making, and for the formulation and conveyance of advice to the Chancellor of the UW Bothell Campus on a wide range of matters related to the mission of the UW Bothell. General Staff Organization The General Staff Organization (GSO) is a committee of staff members at UW Bothell who work together to promote staff engagement. All staff are members of the GSO! Office of Sponsored Research The faculty student experience is paramount at UW Bothell and due to the nature of being a primarily undergraduate institution, faculty have competing priorities and limited time. Therefore, UW Bothells Office of Sponsored Research offers support to advance their research agenda and maximize their community impact while creating conditions for faculty student connections.
