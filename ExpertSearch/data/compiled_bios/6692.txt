He trained in internal medicine at the Harvard Medical Unit at Boston City Hospital and then spent two years in the Medical Corps of the USAF studying the biological effects of laser radiation. He joined the faculty of the EE Department at MIT in 1969 and also the faculty of the Department of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. He has been active in teaching quantitative physiology to undergraduate and graduate engineering students at MIT, and Introduction to Clinical Medicine to HST MEMP students. Dr. Mark is a fellow of the IEEE, a fellow of the American College of Cardiology, and a founding fellow of the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering. degrees PhD in Electrical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1966 MD, Harvard Medical School, 1965 SB in Electrical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1960 selected awards/societies Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation 2016 Laufman-Greatbatch Award Fellow, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Fellow, American College of Cardiology Fellow, American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering research Dr. Marks research activities focus on physiological signal processing and database development, cardiovascular modeling, and critical care decision support and predictive modeling. His group launched the NIH-supported PhysioNet (Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals) in 1999 to provide open access to major collections of well-characterized physiologic signals and associated signal processing software. His group and others have continued to add data collections to PhysioNet, and it has been the basis of thousands of research publications worldwide. His NIH-funded project, entitled Critical Care Informatics, is focused on transforming massive archives of critical care clinical data into new knowledge that will improve the efficiency, accuracy, and timeliness of clinical decision making in intensive care. That project has developed a large new publicly accessible ICU database (MIMIC) containing high resolution clinical data from ~60,000 ICU admissions. It has been added to the archives of PhysioNet and currently has more than 5,000 credentialed users worldwide. Dr. Marks own research has depended critically on access to physiologic and clinical data, and he is firmly committed to the importance of making such data freely available to the research community. selected publications A.
