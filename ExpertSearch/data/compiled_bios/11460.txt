Her research integrates the knowledge in biology, nonlinear solid mechanics, and finite element modeling, especially of complex materials and constitutive behavior. Professor Zhang believes that the interplay between fundamental analysis and clinical application will provide the greatest gains. Through her research, she hopes to provide insights on understanding the relationship between microscopic biological processes and changes in macroscopic tissue mechanics due to diseases, and help the development of diagnostic, therapeutic, and pharmaceutical techniques. Her research interest also lies in the mechanical characterization and multi-scale modeling of micro- and nano-electromechanical systems. Professor Zhangs current research projects are in the characterization of the biomechanical behavior of native and engineered blood vessels using an integrative approach of mechanical testing combined with multi-scale modeling, understanding of the inelastic deformation mechanisms in micro- and nano-electromechanical systems and relations of these behaviors to design, analysis, and device performance.
