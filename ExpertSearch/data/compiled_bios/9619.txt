Anantram earned his B.Sc. in Applied Science from P.S.G. College of Technology, Coimbatore, India, his M.Sc. degree in Physics from the University of Pune, India, and his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Purdue University. He has worked at the NASA Ames Research Centers Center for Nanotechnology and was a professor at the University of Waterloo before joining the University of Washington.Anantrams group at the UW works on the theory, algorithm and application of modeling methods for nanoscale materials and devices. The groups current focus is on fast algorithms to calculate Gless, modeling of electron transport in DNA and multi-scale modeling of memory devices such as phase change and resistive memory devices.
