TheApteResearch Group is currently working on development of advanced numerical algorithms and models for simulations ofmultiphysicsturbulent flows using predictive numerical techniques such as direct and large-eddy simulations. Applications of current interest include bubble-ladencavitatingflows, clean coal technology and oxy-coal reactors, solar fuels and biofuel reforming, and particle-laden turbulent flows such as those occur in fluidized beds, sprays, and two-phasemicrochannelheat sinks. Dr.Apte'sresearch has been supported by the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, Office of Naval Research, US Army, and Oregon BEST solar initiative.
