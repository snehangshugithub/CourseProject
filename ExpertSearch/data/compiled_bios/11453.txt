His group uses state-of-the-art nanofabrication techniques to create functional micro and nanostructures. They use these small structures along with highly sensitive electrical and optical measurement techniques to study diverse fundamental phenomena in solid mechanics, fluid dynamics and biological physics. They are also engaged in developing nanoscale devices and ultrasensitive measurement techniques for a variety of applications in biotechnology.
