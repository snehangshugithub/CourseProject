M.S., Probability, Universit Paris 6, France, 2007. M.S., Computer Science, Telecom Paris, France, 2007. B.S., Mathematics and Physics, cole Polytechnique, France, 2006. Research Interests My research lies in probability theory (random matrices, stochastic analysis) and its connections with other domains of mathematics (partial differential equations, analytic number theory). My current main interest is in the random matrix universality class, a paradigm for complex statistical physics statistics. Selected Publications P. Bourgade, H.-T. Yau and J.
