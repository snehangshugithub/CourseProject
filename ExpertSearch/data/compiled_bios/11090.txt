This territory includes metrological instruments whose precision is limited by the quantum projection noise of millions of atoms; and materials whose bulk properties emerge from many-body interactions intractable to simulation on classical computers. Professor Schleier-Smiths research aims to advance our control and understanding of many-particle quantum systems by engineering new quantum states and Hamiltonians with ensembles of laser-cooled atoms. 2021-22 Courses Atoms, Fields and PhotonsAPPPHYS 203 (Aut) Quantum Information: Visions and Emerging TechnologiesPHYSICS 14N (Spr) Independent Studies (3) Independent Research and StudyPHYSICS 190 (Aut, Win, Spr) ResearchPHYSICS 490 (Aut, Win, Spr, Sum) Senior Thesis ResearchPHYSICS 205 (Aut, Win) Prior Year Courses 2020-21 Courses Atoms, Fields and PhotonsAPPPHYS 203 (Aut) Quantum Information: Visions and Emerging TechnologiesPHYSICS 14N (Win) 2019-20 Courses Atoms, Fields and PhotonsAPPPHYS 203 (Aut) Quantum Information: Visions and Emerging TechnologiesPHYSICS 14N (Spr) Stanford Advisees Doctoral Dissertation Reader (AC) James Allen, David Berryrieser, Agnetta Cleland, Ben Garber, Ronen Kroeze, Kuan-Yu Lin, Tina Na Narong, Hunter Swan, Anna Wang, Zhaoyou Wang Postdoctoral Faculty Sponsor Philipp Kunkel, Shankari Rajagopal Doctoral Dissertation Advisor (AC) Eric Cooper, Jacob Hines, Avikar Periwal, Michelle Wu, Tony Zhang Postdoctoral Research Mentor Shankari Rajagopal All Publications Protecting Spin Coherence in a Tunable Heisenberg Model PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS Davis, E.

C., Schleier-Smith, M., Vishwanath, A., Yao, N. Y. 2017; 119 (12): 123601 Abstract We propose and analyze two distinct routes toward realizing interacting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases via periodic driving. First, we demonstrate that a driven transverse-field Ising model can be used to engineer complex interactions which enable the emulation of an equilibrium SPT phase. This phase remains stable only within a parametric time scale controlled by the driving frequency, beyond which its topological features break down. To overcome this issue, we consider an alternate route based upon realizing an intrinsically Floquet SPT phase that does not have any equilibrium analog. In both cases, we show that disorder, leading to many-body localization, prevents runaway heating and enables the observation of coherent quantum dynamics at high energy densities. Furthermore, we clarify the distinction between the equilibrium and Floquet SPT phases by identifying a unique micromotion-based entanglement spectrum signature of the latter. Finally, we propose a unifying implementation in a one-dimensional chain of Rydberg-dressed atoms and show that protected edge modes are observable on realistic experimental time scales.

In condensed-matter systems, a wide range of phenomena stem from the geometry of the band eigenstates, which is encoded in the matrix-valued Wilson line for general multiband systems. Using an ultracold gas of rubidium atoms loaded in a honeycomb optical lattice, we realize strong-force dynamics in Bloch bands that are described by Wilson lines and observe an evolution in the band populations that directly reveals the band geometry. Our technique enables a full determination of band eigenstates, Berry curvature, and topological invariants, including single- and multiband Chern and Z numbers.

We realize an atomic interferometer to measure Berry flux in momentum space, in analogy to an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer that measures magnetic flux in real space. We demonstrate the interferometer for a graphene-type hexagonal optical lattice loaded with bosonic atoms. By detecting the singular Berry flux localized at each Dirac point, we establish the high momentum resolution of this interferometric technique. Our work forms the basis for a general framework to fully characterize topological band structures.

D., Schleier-Smith, M. H., Vuletic, V. 2010; 104 (25) Abstract We study experimentally the application of a class of entangled states, squeezed spin states, to the improvement of atomic-clock precision. In the presence of anisotropic noise, the entanglement lifetime is strongly dependent on squeezing orientation. We measure the Allan deviation spectrum of a clock operated with a phase-squeezed input state. For averaging times up to 50s the squeezed clock achieves a given precision 2.8(3)times faster than a clock operating at the standard quantum limit.

D., Schleier-Smith, M. H., Vuletic, V. 2010; 104 (7) Abstract We squeeze unconditionally the collective spin of a dilute ensemble of laser-cooled 87Rb atoms using their interaction with a driven optical resonator. The shape and size of the resulting spin uncertainty region are well described by a simple analytical model [M. H. Schleier-Smith, I. D. Leroux, and V. Vuleti, arXiv:0911.3936 [Phys. Rev. A (to be published)]] through 2 orders of magnitude in the effective interaction strength, without free parameters. We deterministically generate states with up to 5.6(6) dB of metrologically relevant spin squeezing on the canonical 87Rb hyperfine clock transition.

H., Leroux, I. D., Vuletic, V. 2010; 104 (7) Abstract We generate entangled states of an ensemble of 5x10{4} 87Rb atoms by optical quantum nondemolition measurement. The resonator-enhanced measurement leaves the atomic ensemble, prepared in a superposition of hyperfine clock levels, in a squeezed spin state. By comparing the resulting reduction of quantum projection noise [up to 8.8(8) dB] with the concomitant reduction of coherence, we demonstrate a clock input state with spectroscopic sensitivity 3.0(8) dB beyond the standard quantum limit.

H., Leroux, I. D., Zhang, H., Van Camp, M. A., Vuletic, V. 2011; 107 (14) Abstract We demonstrate cavity sideband cooling of a single collective motional mode of an atomic ensemble down to a mean phonon occupation number n(min)=2.0(-0.3)(+0.9). Both n(min) and the observed cooling rate are in good agreement with an optomechanical model. The cooling rate constant is proportional to the total photon scattering rate by the ensemble, demonstrating the cooperative character of the light-emission-induced cooling process. We deduce fundamental limits to cavity cooling either the collective mode or, sympathetically, the single-atom degrees of freedom.

L., Kupper, J., Friedrich, B., Schleier-Smith, M., Haak, H., Meijer, G. 2007; 111 (31): 7411-7419 Abstract A linear AC trap for polar molecules in high-field seeking states has been devised and implemented, and its characteristics have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The trap is loaded with slow 15ND3 molecules in their ground state (para-ammonia) from a Stark decelerator. The trap's geometry offers optimal access as well as improved loading. We present measurements of the dependence of the trap's performance on the switching frequency, which exhibit a characteristic structure due to nonlinear resonance effects. The molecules are found to oscillate in the trap under the influence of the trapping forces, which were analyzed using 3D numerical simulations. On the basis of expansion measurements, molecules with a velocity and a position spread of 2.1 m/s and 0.4 mm, respectively, are still accepted by the trap. This corresponds to a temperature of 2.0 mK. From numerical simulations, we find the phase-space volume that can be confined by the trap (the acceptance) to be 50 mm3 (m/s)3.

N., Crespi, V. H., Schleier-Smith, M. H., Ellenbogen, J. C. 2004; 92 (8) Abstract We investigate the interaction of a carbon nanotube with a graphite substrate, using an interlayer potential that explicitly treats the registry dependence of the interaction. The carbon-carbon bond lengths in nanotubes differ slightly from those in flat graphite, so that the naively commensurate angular orientations for the tube with respect to the substrate lattice are destroyed. The interaction of a one-dimensional tube with a two-dimensional substrate then leads to an unusual registry phenomenon not visible in standard layer-on-layer growth: the system develops favorable orientations which clearly are incommensurate.
