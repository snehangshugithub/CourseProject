We study the cellular events involved in this process and the attendant roles for regulatory genes that control regeneration steps. We utilize an array of methodologies, including high-throughput sequencing, RNA interference (RNAi) screening, and numerous assays and tools for phenotypic analysis to characterize regeneration regulatory genes.
