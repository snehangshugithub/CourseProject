His research ranges from geometric variational problems in the intersection homology theory on singular varieties to the theory of ramified optimal transportation with branching structures, and also to very applied problems modeling the formation of the shapes in tree leaves, mud cracking and placentas. Some of his work extends to geometric analysis, combinatorial optimization, mathematical biology, and fractal geometry. Selected Publications "The formation of a tree leaf. " ESAIM Control Optim.
