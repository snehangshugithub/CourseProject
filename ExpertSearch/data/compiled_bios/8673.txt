She is the recipient of the DOE CAREER award and serves as the thrust lead for dynamic characterization for the DOE EFRC Multi-Scale Fluid-Solid Interactions in Natural and Architected Materials (MUSE). She was selected as the Rising Stars in Civil and Environmental Engineering by MIT. Prior to Cornell, Dr. Gadikota served on the faculty at the University of Wisconsin Madison and was a postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University and Columbia University, with a research appointment at the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). Dr. Gadikota received her PhD in Chemical Engineering and earned her MS degrees in Chemical Engineering and Operations Research, all from Columbia University. Her BS in Chemical Engineering is from Michigan State University.Research InterestsWith more than 80% of our energy resources recovered from the subsurface environments which requires about 50 billion cubic meters of fresh water and contributes to more than 75% of global CO2emissions, our grand societal challenge lies in meeting our growing demand for energy and resources while reducing environmental impact. Addressing these earth-scale challenges requires us to develop novel technologies to engineer targeted physico-chemical interactions in complex engineered and natural environments. Enabling emergent technologies for a sustainable earth requires us to advance the cross-scale science of fluid-solid interactions in complex and extreme environments. With this perspective, our research is directed towards applications that involve (i) engineering the natural environment for sustainable energy and resource recovery and (ii) designing novel chemical pathways for advancing low carbon and negative emissions technologies.Environmental ProcessesGeotechnical EngineeringSelected PublicationsM.
