Advanced Topics in Computer Systems, TuTh 2:00PM - 3:29PM, Soda 310 Spring 2022 CS 162. Operating Systems and System Programming, TuTh 3:30PM - 4:59PM, Valley Life Sciences 2050 Biography He received a double B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Physics, 1987, M.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 1993, and a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Minor in Physics, 1998, all from M.I.T.He joined the faculty of EECS at UC Berkeley in 1998. Current research includes exploring the design of extremely-wide area storage utilities and developing secure protocols and routing infrastructures that provide privacy, security, and resistance to denial of service, while still allowing the caching of data anywhere, anytime. Also, exploring the space of Introspective Computing, namely systems which perform continuous, on-line adaptation. Applications include on-chip tolerance of flaky components and continuous optimization to adapt to server failures and denial of service attacks.Honors and awards include the Diane S.
