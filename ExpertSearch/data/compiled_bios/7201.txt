She did her postdoctoral work at the University of Michigan and North Carolina State University before joining the faculty at RPI in 2008. She won the Norbert J. Kreidl Award, the highest honor bestowed upon a student by the Glass and Optical Materials Division of the American Ceramic Society in 2003. In 2009, she was a recipient of the Defense Treat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Young Investigator Award and the RAMP-UP Career Campaign Award from Rensselaer. In 2013, she won the National Science Foundation CAREER award and the Alfred H. Geisler Memorial Award from the Eastern NY ASM Chapter. In 2018 Dr. Huang was appointed Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Programs in the School of Engineering.
