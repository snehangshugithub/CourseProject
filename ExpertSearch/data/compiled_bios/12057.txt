He is also the co-founder and the Chief Scientist of UltraSoC Technologies Ltd (a Venture Capital backed semiconductor startup company) and the co-founder and CEO of Metrarc Limited (a startup company commercialising cybersecurity research outcomes). Klaus McDonald-Maier studied Electronic Engineering at the University of Ulm (Germany), Cardiff University (Wales), and the cole Suprieur de Chimie Physique lectronique de Lyon (CPE-Lyon, France). He completed his doctorate at the Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena (Germany) in 1999, in the area of high performance parallel Neural Network computer architectures and neural networks based control of legged robots. Following this he worked on Systems-on-Chip (SoC) at Infineon Technologies AG (formerly Siemens Semiconductors), Munich (Germany), where he was a Systems Architect for SoC platform based reusable microprocessor cores and peripheral modules as well as debug support for industrial control SoC platforms, used as the standard controller core in many automotive industrial and embedded SoCs. In 2001 he returned to academia and led significant research endeavours in the area of embedded systems, computer architecture, Systems-on-Chip and their application in robotics and intelligent systems. Initially he joined the University of Kent as Lecturer in Digital Systems, then moved to the University of Essex, as Reader in 2005, and was promoted to Professor of Embedded and Intelligent Systems in 2008. He has held visiting Professor positions at INRIA Nord and ESIGELEC. Since 2013 he is a Visiting Research Affiliate at the Advanced Robotics Group of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and a Visiting Professor at the University of Kent.
