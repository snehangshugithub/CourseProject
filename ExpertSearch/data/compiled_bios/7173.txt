I was involved in experiments at Stanford, Fermilab, Cornell, and Brookhaven. Since 2002, I have shifted my focus to observational cosmology. I have been helping to build cameras for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). My primary science interests are the properties of the dark matter and dark energy. I also hope to use measurements of the large scale structure to constrain (and possibly measure) the neutrino mass.
