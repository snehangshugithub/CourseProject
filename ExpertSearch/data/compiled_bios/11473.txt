Recent research in SOFCs include enhancing catalytic activity of anodes by infiltration, understanding and mitigating surface instabilities in cathode materials, understanding and mitigating cathode poisoning using coatings on interconnections, and quantitative characterization of porous 3-D electrode microstructures. Recent research in optical fibers include understanding processing/structure/property relationships in germanium-, silicon- and germanium/silicon alloy-core optical fibers fabricated by the molten core method.
