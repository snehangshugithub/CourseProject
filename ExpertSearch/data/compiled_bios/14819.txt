These currents heat initially solid materials to a high energy density (HED) plasma state, with temperatures of millions of degrees, magnetic fields of a few Tesla and up, and velocities of hundreds of kilometers per second. These plasmas dimensionlessly scale to astrophysical objects, allowing us to study the most extreme events in the Universe in our laboratory. Magnetic Reconnection This ubiquitous phenomenon is responsible for some of the most dynamic and spectacular events in the universe, such as solar flares erupting from the surface of our Sun. Reconnection occurs whenever non-aligned magnetic fields meet within a plasma. Reconnection causes an explosive change in field topology, along with a rapid conversion of magnetic energy into thermal and kinetic energy. I am interested in laboratory experiments which study instabilities within the reconnection layer, pathways to fully turbulent reconnection, the effects of strong radiative cooling, and kinetic physics. Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence Hydrodynamic turbulence is one of the outstanding challenges of modern physics, and MHD turbulence adds in electromagnetic fields and charged particles to increase the complexity even further. Most of the universe is plasma, and most of that plasma is turbulent: hence MHD turbulence underpins the bewildering diversity of behaviors that we observe in astrophysical plasmas. We create and study these plasmas in the laboratory, producing high quality data which enables us to test and assess numerical simulations and theoretical models Publications Recent Publications L G Suttle, G C Burdiak, C L Cheung, T Clayson, J W D Halliday, J D Hare, S Rusli, et al.
