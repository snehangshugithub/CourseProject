Digital Measures Activity Insight 101 is an online data collection and management portal used by Georgia State University faculty to enter, manage, and report on professional information pertaining to their teaching, research, and service activities. Faculty are encouraged to track their achievements in Digital Measures throughout the year as a means of preparing for annual reviews. Digital Measures Activity Insight: Provides a single place to keep current information about professional accomplishments Can record activity throughout the year, reducing the need for chairs and the college to make solicitations for reports for accrediting agencies, the University System, news media, and various university offices Can produce faculty-specific customized reports (including a personalized annual report and CV) as well as broader, college and university-wide summary reports that pull data from across multiple years Features several bulk publication import options from third-party sources (e.g. Google Scholar [via BibTex file], CrossRef, PubMed, Web of Science, and more) DIGITAL MEASURES Tools for First-Time Users and the Forgetful If this is your first time using Digital Measures, please click on the learning materials provided here. Digital Measures is designed to allow faculty the flexibility to enter a wide range of achievements. This flexibility can seem overwhelming to new or occasional users, so if youre new to Digital Measures or struggling to work your way through the layout, please download our Digital Measures Faculty Guide. We also have a video version with additional information, if youd like a more in-depth review of the system.
