To understand the processes that underlie phenotypic and lineage diversification, I integrate studies of morphology, function, behavior, and ecology (= ecomorphology) within an evolutionary context. My work is largely focused on bats, as they are one of the most ecologically and morphologically diverse lineages of mammals and thus offer a natural experiment to investigate patterns and mechanisms of diversification. I apply comparative, integrative and interdisciplinary approaches, involving data collection in the field from free-ranging animals, along with modern lab techniques and quantitative tools. By doing this work in a broad evolutionary context, my research is able to test hypotheses about adaptation and drivers of diversification. 2021-present: Professor, Department of Biology, University of Washington. 2012-present: Curator of Mammals, Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, University of Washington. 2019-2021: Fulbright Scholar, Costa Rica. 2017-2021: Associate Professor, Department of Biology, University of Washington. 2012-2017: Assistant Professor, Department of Biology, University of Washington. 20112013: Faculty Institutes for Reforming Science Teaching Scholar. 2010-2012: Postdoctoral Fellow.
