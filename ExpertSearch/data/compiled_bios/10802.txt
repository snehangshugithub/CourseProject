Some examples of complex fluids in living systems include macromolecular entities like DNA and proteins, and larger structures such as the cytoskeleton. A few synthetic examples include suspensions, emulsions, foams, liquid crystals and polymeric liquids. We use theory and simulation to relate the collective behavior of complex fluids to the microscopic interactions of their building blocks, towards developing predictive theories for living and synthetically engineered complex fluids.
