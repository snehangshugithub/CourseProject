Coble Award for Young Scholars. Research Statement My research focuses on linking atomic-scale processes in materials to the microstructural level and bulk properties. Much of the current work relates to the role of structure, defects, and interfaces in affecting materials for energy applications. Significant effort is being directed towards developing novel in-situ characterization methods that can serve as platforms for materials development and discovery.Many critical phenomena that control materials processing and performance occur at interfaces, surface, grain boundaries, and other internal defects. The nature of the structure and dynamics of these interfaces and defects are highly complex and fully understanding them has been an ongoing challenge. As engineered materials become more complex and as microstructural length scales are reduced toward the nanoscale, the role of interfaces has become increasingly important in affecting performance. Many questions about the distributions of interfaces and defects; their structure, chemistry, energy, and effect on bulk properties still remain. Multi-scale approaches are critical for detailing the local structure of defects and their distribution within materials. Ongoing research seeks to apply advanced in situ characterization techniques; particularly in extreme environments such as at high temperatures, in irradiative fluxes, or in large fields. Promoting and exploiting advances in characterization enables new insights into scientific and engineering problems; such as optimizing materials. The development of new scientific paradigms will enable novel approaches to engineering materials of practical importance.
