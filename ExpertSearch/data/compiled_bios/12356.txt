We also use plant natural productswithspecific medicinal properties as chemical probes to query human disorders like metabolic syndromes and protein-misfolding diseases. Ultimately, we hope to elucidate the molecularmechanisms underlying the "matrix effect" evident in many traditional herbal remedies.
