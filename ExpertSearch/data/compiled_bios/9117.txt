She has a joint appointment with the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Systems Design Engineering and is cross-appointed with the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at University of Waterloo. She is Visiting Professor at the University of Hertfordshire, UK. In Waterloo she is director of Social and Intelligent Robotics Research Laboratory (SIRRL). The main areas of her research are Human-Robot Interaction, Social Robotics, Assistive Technology and Artificial Life. She is Editor in Chief (jointly with Prof. Angelo Cangelosi - University of Manchester, UK) of the Journal Interaction Studies- Social Behaviour and Communication in Biological and Artificial Systems published by John Benjamins Publishing Company, Editorial Board Member of Adaptive Behavior, Sage Publications, Associate Editor of the International Journal of Social Robotics, published by Springer, and Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems (previously IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development). She is an Editor of the book series Advances in Interaction Studies, published by John Benjamins Publishing Company. Prof. Dautenhahn is on the Advisory Board of the journal AI and Society (Springer). She is a IEEE Fellow, member of ACM, and a Lifelong Fellow of AISB, as well as a member of the Executive Board of the International Foundation for Responsible Robotics. Since 2006 she has been part of the Standing Steering Committee of the IEEE conference RO-MAN (Human and Robot Interactive Communication).Research InterestsHuman-robot InteractionSocial RoboticsRobot-Assisted TherapyAssistive TechnologyArtificial IntelligenceArtificial LifeEducation1993, Dr. rer. nat., Natural Sciences, University of Bielefeld1990, Diploma, Biology, University of BielefeldCourses*ECE 493 - Special Tpcs in Elec &CompTaught in 2021ECE 750 - Topics in Computer SoftwareTaught in 2019, 2020, 2021SYDE 750 - Topics in Systems ModellingTaught in 2019, 2020, 2021* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsJohn Edison Munoz, Kerstin Dautenhahn (2021) Robo Ludens A game design taxonomy for multiplayer games using socially interactive robots.
