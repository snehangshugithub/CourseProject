As a faculty member at MIT, Dr. Gallant leads the Energy and Gas Conversion Laboratory, whichfocuses on advanced battery chemistries and materials for high-energy rechargeable and primary batteries, including fluorinated cathode conversion reactions and lithium and calcium metal anodes and their interfaces.Her research is also developing insights into reaction mechanisms that underpin advanced greenhouse gas mitigation technologies, with a particular emphasis on integration of electrochemistry with CO2capture and storage.Her group has pioneered the scientific framework behind use of amine capture sorbents in electrochemical environments subject to direct reductive conversion, driving CO2to products or storage phases, which has potential to contribute to alternatives of todays energy-intensive thermal regeneration processes.Dr. Gallant is the recipient of multiple awards including an MIT Bose Fellow, Army Research Office Young Investigator Award, Scialog Fellow in Energy Storage and in Negative Emissions Science, NSF CAREER Award, the Ruth and Joel Spira Award for Distinguished Teaching at MIT, and the Electrochemical Society Battery Division Early Career award.
