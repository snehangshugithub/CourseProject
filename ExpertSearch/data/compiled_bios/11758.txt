We develop models for physical processes that determine how vegetated habitats (green infrastructure), such as seagrasses, salt marsh, and mangroves, provide coastal protection, mitigate anthropogenic nutrient and pollutant loads, and provide blue carbon reservoirs, with the goal of applying these models to improve the management of natural resources and the design of green infrastructure.Teaching InterestsFluid mechanics, surface water transport processes, physical limnology.Selected PublicationsFor selected publications please visit Professor Nepfshome page.Subscribe to our newsletter Email* CommentsThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
