News July 2021: Check out this interesting summer internship on AI and ML:https://gradientinstitute.org/about-us/summer-scholar-2021-2022/ May 2021: I have a fully funded PhD scholarship available. Please apply! (See my notes above) PhD under my supervision Interested in doing your PhD under my supervision? Check out this website. You find a detailed list of my teaching activities on my personal website. I am almost exclusively working in automated planning, one of the main disciplines of Artificial Intelligence. I am primarily interested in Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning, which is a hierachical approach to planning, where tasks are refined step-wise until a primitive executable plan is obtained. Closely related is the problem class of HTN planning with task insertion (TIHTN planning), where we are also allowed to insert actions arbitrarily thus combining HTN planning with classical planning. (I also created a website on hierarchical planning.) I'm also interested in partial order causal link (POCL) planning, a planning approach based on search in the space of plans. Here, reasoning about partially ordered actions become of major importance. Within all these frameworks, research questions/areas that I'm mostly interested in are: Complexity investigations, specificlally for the plan existence problem (Is there a solution?) Heuristic search, i.e., algorithm and heuristic design. Potential student projects Supervisor Multi-Agent Path Finding as Planning PhD or Research Project: Various topics From Theory to Practice in Planning Research Project: A Systematic View on Complexity Results for HTN Planning Research Project: Heuristic Search in Hierarchical Planning Research Project: Modeling and Solving Puzzle Games Using CSPs/ILPs/SAT (AI) Research Project: On Hierarchical Planning in Games Research Project: On the Relationship between HTN planning and Formal Grammars Advisor List of researchers working in AI Planning Research projects from other areas Complete student projects Supervisor Research Project: Modeling and Solving the Waiter's Tray Puzzle using AI Planning Research Project: Solving Sokoban Puzzles You can also find me on Google Scholar and in DBLP Detailed lists of my publications, sorted by publication venue, can be found on my personal website. Conny Olz You find all my honours and awards on my personal website. You find all my service roles (past and present) listed on my personal webpage. But since it's "important", let me mention here that since November 2021 I am: A first aider for the Hanna Neumann building I'm also a mental first aider (technically also for Hanna Neumann, but everybody can approach me of course) On my personal website, you can find: Resources for students, e.g., LaTeX slides template, presentations about creating slides and project reports, paper recommendations, and much more. Course Material, e.g., slides or video recordings. Some (non-professional) entertaining links, like (fun!) educational youtube channels, comics with academic context etc. Updated:10 August 2021/Responsible Officer:Dean, CECS/Page Contact:CECS Marketing Contact ANU Copyright Disclaimer Privacy Freedom of Information +61 2 6125 5111 The Australian National University, Canberra CRICOS Provider : 00120C ABN : 52 234 063 906 You appear to be using Internet Explorer 7, or have compatibility view turned on.
