She teaches in both of the undergraduate and graduate programs. Her courses include Speech Sound Disorders (UG), Clinical Phonetics (UG), Professional Issues in Speech-Language Pathology, Advanced Capstone (Grad), and Advanced Speech Sound Disorders (Grad). Dantuma teaches with a teach, practice, do philosophy that allows students to learn using guided practice of assessment and treatment techniques, and an opportunity to apply those techniques to simulations and case studies. Dantuma leads two service learning trips to Belize and to Uganda, in which she teaches students therapy skills, cultural competence, and loving through actions. She is interested in the application of technology use and telepractice for meeting the needs of individuals who do not have access to speech-language pathologists. Dantuma integrates 'imago dei", all people are created in the image of God, as the foundation for all of her teaching. People with disabilities, people who are angry, people who are from other cultures, and who are different from us, are all created in the image of God. As children of God they deserve our best treatment, our deepest compassion, and our love.
