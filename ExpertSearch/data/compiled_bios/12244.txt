Audience Tools Search Menu Faculty > Anind K. Dey Anind K. Dey CV Dean and Professor anind@uw.edu Mary Gates Hall 370 Affiliate Position Adjunct Professor, University of Washington Department of Human-Centered Design and Engineering Specializations Human-computer interaction Machine learning and artificial intelligence Ubiquitous and mobile computing Research Areas Human-Computer Interaction Health and Well-Being Biography Anind K. Dey is a Professor and Dean of the Information School and Adjunct Professor in the Department of Human-Centered Design and Engineering. Anind is renowned for his early work in context-aware computing, an important theme in modern computing, where computational processes are aware of the context in which they operate and can adapt appropriately to that context. His research is at the intersection of human-computer interaction, machine learning, and ubiquitous computing. For the past few years, Anind has focused on passively collecting large amounts of data about how people interact with their phones and the objects around them, to use for producing detection and classification models for human behaviors of interest. He applies a human-centered and problem-based approach through a collaboration with an amazing collection of domain experts in areas of substance abuse (alcohol, marijuana, opioids), mental health, driving and transportation needs, smart spaces, sustainability, and education. Anind was inducted into the ACM SIGCHI Academy for his significant contributions to the field of human-computer interaction in 2015.
