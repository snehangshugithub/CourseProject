For the past twenty three years, Professor Cramer and his students have combined elegant theoretical models and rigorous experimentation to make dramatic advances in several areas of preparative protein chromatography. He serves as a consultant and/or member of the scientific board for several biotechnology and separations companies. In addition, Professor Cramer is known worldwide for his expertise in separations in general. He is the Editor-in-Chief of the International journal Separations, Science and Technology. Professor Cramer was the awarded the prestigious Alan S. Michaels Award for the Recovery of Biological Products (ACS Division of Biochemical Technology). He was also awarded Rensselaers School of Engineering Research Excellence Award, a Presidential Young Investigator award from the National Science Foundation, the Early Career Award from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as well as several teaching awards. Professor Cramer was elected a fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering. He has also chaired several prestigious meetings including the International HIC/RPC Bioseparations Conference, the ACS Recovery of Biological Products Meeting and the Gordon Conference on Reactive Polymers. He is also the U.S. coordinator of the NSF sponsored Eastern Mediterranean Chemical Engineering Conference Series. Prof. Cramer has published over 140 papers in peer-reviewed journals and has 9 patents. Importantly, he has produced over 33 Ph.D. students who have gone on to leadership positions in the biotechnology industry and academia.
