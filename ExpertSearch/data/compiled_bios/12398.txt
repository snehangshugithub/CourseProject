MacArthur Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics Emeritus; Professor of Cell and Molecular Biology, Scripps Research Institute Paul Schimmel has worked throughout his career to translate bench-side research into tangible products that improve human health including those related to alcoholism, schizophrenia, autism, AIDS, heart disease, and cancer. schimmel@scripps.edu Email Lab Website Education PhD, 1966, MIT Research Summary Paul Schimmels research interests have focused on aminoacyl tRNA synthetases an ancient and universal set of essential enzymes. His laboratory has worked on a universal mechanism for correcting errors in the interpretation of genetic information, and went on to show how this mechanism is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing serious pathologies and disease. His laboratory also discovered what others refer to as a tRNA synthetase-directed primordial or second genetic code, which was eventually incorporated into the modern code. In a separate line of research published back in 1983, Schimmel developed the concept of what are now known as ESTs (expressed sequence tags), and the strategy of shotgun sequencing approaches that were adopted into the human genome project several years later. Lastly, his laboratory connected synthetases to disease and, most recently, they reported the structural and functional metamorphosis of these proteins, whereby they are repurposed with novel activities, both inside and outside the cell, in a variety of cell signaling pathways.
