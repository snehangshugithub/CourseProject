Assistant(s) Research Group Matters Mikaela Laite 262 Gates-Thomas Laboratory (626) 395-4128 mlaite@caltech.edu Research Group Website Personal Website Research Overview Professor Colonius studies complex, multiscale flow phenomena and their control using theory, numerical experiments, and simulations. Simulations from his lab have provided key insights into such subject areas as turbulence, instabilities, sources of sound, and shock and bubble dynamics. His research has broad applicationsfrom ultrasound imaging and therapy to mitigating jet noise to generating energy from flow systems. List of Research Areas Fluid dynamics: global instabilities, cavitation and bubble dynamics, aerodynamic sound. Control: closed-loop flow control and reduced-order modeling. Biomedical fluid dynamics: shock-waves, lithotripsy and ultrasound. Numerical methods: interface capturing, immersed-boundary methods, high-order-accurate methods, and nonreflecting boundary conditions.
