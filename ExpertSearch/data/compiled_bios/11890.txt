Her primary research interests are in the development of orthopedic biomaterials, and biomaterial characterization utilizing a combination of experimental techniques, nanoindentation, and computational modeling. Dr. Blum is also interested in characterizing the tribological performance of biological tissues using soft material contact mechanics and simulation. Understanding the structure-property relationships of biological tissues during contacting motion aids her lab in the development of synthetic biomimetic materials.
