The transfer of vesicular cargo between organelles is finalized by the fusing of two membrane bilayers into a continuous membrane. Membrane fusion is catalyzed by proteins called SNAREs that are present on both donor and acceptor membranes. Although seemingly straight forward, membrane fusion is highly orchestrated and tightly controlled to prevent unchecked fusion when unwanted, or missorting cargo to the wrong organelle. Thus, it is essential to regulate membrane trafficking and fusion to maintain homeostasis. Many proteins control these pathways, yet the role of the membrane itself remains underappreciated. Membranes contain a small, yet critical group of Regulatory Lipids that aid in signal transduction, recruit proteins to their site of action, or alter membrane curvature and fluidity to modulate protein function. In the context of membrane fusion, regulatory lipids are essential for the fusion of synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane, autophagosomes-to-lysosome fusion, phagosome-endosome fusion, et cetera. Regulatory lipids are essential throughout the different stages of membrane fusion and their effects can be altered though modification. Phosphoinositides, for example, can be differentially phosphorylated and dephosphorylated by specific kinase and phosphatases, or hydrolyzed by various lipases. My lab focuses on how lipid modification affects protein function in the fusion pathway. It is clear that dysregulation of lipid modification has severe deleterious effects on fusion and overall cellular upkeep. In many cases pathologies have been mapped to lipid modifying enzymes, however, their effects on membrane function and cellular homeostasis is often unknown. Our long term goal is to bridge the gap between mapping diseases to genes and understanding the underlying mechanisms of the corresponding pathologies. Current projects include: I.

(Top) A schematic view of vacuoles showing the three morphological features that are developed during docking and fusion. (Bottom) Epifluorescence images of purified vacuoles in an in vitro docking assay. Vacuoles isolated from yeast harboring Vps33p-GFP were incubated with fluorescent Cy3-labeled FYVE domain to specifically localize PI(3)P. Cy3-FYVE is shown in red. To view the entire cluster of membranes, phosphatidylserine (PS), which is evenly distributed on vacuoles, was labeled with the fluorescent probe PSS-380 and is shown in blue. Solid arrows show examples of vertex sites enriched in Vps33p and PI(3)P. Hollow arrows specify outer membrane microdomains. Bar, 2 m.
