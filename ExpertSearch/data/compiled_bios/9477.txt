She has conducted research on digital advertising, user-generated content, social networks, location-based targeting, smart technologies, peer-to-peer markets and recycling.

She uses game theory, causal inferences and experimentation in her research, which has appeared in top marketing journals and been mentioned in popular media outlets such as BBC, Forbes, and NPR. Monic is currently an Associate Editor at Management Science and serves on the editorial boards of Marketing Science and Journal of Marketing Research.
