He is the Founding Director of PARADISE Research Laboratory at Ottawa U. Prior to this, he held a faculty position at the University of North Texas, USA. He worked as a Senior Scientist at the Simulation Sciences Division, Metron Corporation located in San Diego. He was also employed as a Faculty at the School of Computer Science McGill University, and taught at Polytechnic of Montreal. He spent a year at the JPL/NASA-California Institute of Technology where he contributed to a project centered about the specification and verification of the software used to control interplanetary spacecraft operated by JPL/NASA Laboratory. His current research interests include sensor networks, mobile ad hoc networks, mobile and pervasive computing, wireless multimedia, QoS service provisioning, performance evaluation and modeling of large-scale distributed systems, distributed computing, large-scale distributed interactive simulation, and parallel discrete event simulation. Dr. Boukerche has published several research papers in these areas. Dr. Boukerche is the recipient of the Ontario Distinguished Researcher Award, Ontario Early Researcher Award (previously known as Premier of Ontario Research Excellence Award (PREA)), the Canada Research Chair , the G. S. Glinski Award for Excellence in Research, and the Ontario Distinguished Researcher Award. He was the recipient of the Best Research Paper Award at IEEE/ACM PADS'97, and the recipient of the 3rd National Award for Telecommunication Software 1999 for his work on a distributed security systems on mobile phone operations, and has been nominated for the best paper award at the IEEE/ACM PADS'99, ACM MSWiM 2001, and ACM MobiWac 2004. He is a Co-Founder of QShine Int'l Conference, on Quality of Service for Wireless/Wired Heterogeneous Networks (QShine 2004), served as a General Chair for several conferences, such as ACM/IEEE MASCOST 1998, IEEE DS-RT 1999-2000, ACM MSWiM 2000; Program Chair for ACM/IFIPS Europar 2002, IEEE/SCS Annual Simulation Symposium ANNS 2002, ACM WWW'02, IEEE/ACM MASCOTS 2002, IEEE Wireless Local Networks WLN 03-04; IEEE Wireless, Mobile ad hoc and Sensor Networks (IPDPS/WMAN) 04-05, ACM Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems (MSWiM) 98-99, and TPC member of numerous IEEE and ACM conferences related to wireless communication, mobile computing, ad hoc and sensor networks, and distributed systems. He served as a Guest Editor for the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing (JPDC) (Special Issue for Routing for Mobile Ad hoc, Special Issue for wireless communication and mobile computing, Special Issue for mobile ad hoc networking and computing), and ACM/kluwer Wireless Networks and ACM/Kluwer Mobile Networks Applications, and the Journal of Wireless Communication and Mobile Computing.
