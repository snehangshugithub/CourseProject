Many of the seaweeds that have been investigated are utilized by humans as well as being intrinsically interesting organisms. These include certain red seaweeds (especially Mazzaella [formerly Iridaea] and Chondracanthus (formerly Gigartina) that produce carrageenans (much carrageenan now comes from aquacultured Eucheuma and Kappaphycus from southeast Asia), polymers that find many uses for their gelling and viscosity regulating properties. More recently the biology and systematics of several species of Porphyra was investigated. The edible product \"nori\"" is made from certain species of Porphyra J.
