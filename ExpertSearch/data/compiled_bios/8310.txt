Research Statement Gaurav Bahl performs experimental research at the interface between optical and mechanical systems. Of particular interest are the mechanisms by which light interacts mechanically with photonic microsystems (i.e. via radiation pressure, gradient force, electrostrictive pressure, and photothermal effects), and how mechanical devices can affect and manipulate light. Applications of this research include inertial sensors, microfluidic bio-chemical devices, microwave frequency references, and harsh-environment physical sensors.While the forces exerted on matter by single photons are miniscule, micro/nanodevices that are both optically and mechanically resonant can enhance such opto-mechanical interactions by several orders-of-magnitude. These devices are excellent scientific platforms for research in nonlinear optics, quantum mechanics, laser development, and thermal management via laser heating and cooling. Graduate Research Opportunities PhD oriented Electrical Engineering graduate students with a strong background in experimental optics are encouraged to contact Prof. Bahl with a complete CV. Undergraduate Research Opportunities Our group is seeking talented undergraduate researchers for summer 2015 positions, with the potential for continued work into the school year.Students with strong backgrounds in the following topics are encouraged to apply -- electromagnetics, RF and microwave circuits, photonics, and microfabrication.Interested students should contact Prof. Bahl (bahl@illinois.edu) with a complete CV, accompanied by a short paragraph highlighting relevant experience and coursework.Please see our group website (http://bahl.mechse.illinois.edu) for representative work.Women and students from minority backgrounds are encouraged to apply.
