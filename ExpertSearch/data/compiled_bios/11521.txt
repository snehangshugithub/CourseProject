Lee Contact bplee@mtu.edu 906-487-3262 M&M 401 Professor, Biomedical Engineering PhD, Biomedical Engineering, Northwestern University MS, Biomedical Engineering, Northwestern University BS, Chemical Engineering, Cornell University Biography The Lee group research is focused on applying biologically-inspired molecular designs with chemistry, polymer engineering and materials science principles in developing advanced and functional materials for various biomedical applications. Current projects include applying biomimetic structural designs to create tough hydrogels that can potentially function as tissue adhesives or extracellular matrices for tissue repair and regeneration, and coatings to control biointerface of biomaterials that can prevent non-specific absorption of proteins, cells, and bacteria. Prior to joining Michigan Tech, Dr. Lee helped found a start-up company, Nerites Corporation, which aimed at commercializing biomimetic bioadhesive and antifouling technologies. Nerites Corporation was acquired by Kensey Nash Corporation (part of Royal DSM) in 2011. Dr. Lee was awarded the 2016 Young Investigator Awardby the Office of Naval Research.
