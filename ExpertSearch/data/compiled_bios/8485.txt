Sakulich Civil, Environmental, & Architectural Engineering Associate Professor-Engineering Education:BS Drexel University 2005PhD Drexel University 2010 Replacing our crumbling national infrastructure with conventional materials would be only a temporary solution to a critical problem. My research focuses on developing new, more durable materials for use in infrastructure, which will lead to a lowered maintenance burden, improved user safety, and a reduced environmental impact. Personally, the part that I like most about this subject is the chemistry. I am also interested in appropriate technology for developing nations and preserving our cultural heritage, subjects in which I became interested during the year I spent as a Fulbright grantee in Morocco. I am the Site Director of the Panama City IQP/MQP site. I was once voted cutest baby at a county fair.
