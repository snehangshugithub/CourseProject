Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, 2010 2012 Engineering Degree, Mechatronics, National University of Colombia, 2003 2008 Postdoctoral training, Neurology, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, 2015 2018 Summary Dr. David Escobar is an assistant professor in the Department of Neurology and a member of the Neuromodulation Research Center, where he directs the Neural Dynamics and Control Group. His research is aimed to advance the development of patient-specific brain modulation therapies that maximize effectiveness by controlling neural activity underlying brain dysfunction. Dr. Escobar leverages the fields of neurophysiology, dynamical systems, and feedback (closed-loop) control to identify circuit-level neural dynamics causally linked to the manifestation of brain disorders and to develop closed-loop brain stimulation techniques that control these neural dynamics in real-time. Currently, he is applying these neural circuit analysis and control techniques to better understand how Parkinson's disease alters brain circuitry and to optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatments. Dr. Escobar conducts clinical and preclinical studies with a multidisciplinary team of clinicians, scientists, and engineers in the Neuromodulation Research Center, Udall Center of Excellence for Parkinsons Disease Research, and across departments in the School of Medicine to develop and test comprehensive neuromodulation treatments for Parkinsons and other brain conditions.Dr. Escobar received an M.S. and a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering from the University of Minnesota in 2012 and 2015, respectively. His graduate research was on data-driven modeling of dynamical systems and robust feedback (closed-loop) control. In 2015, he joined the Department of Neurology at the University of Minnesota as a postdoctoral fellow where he conducted preclinical and clinical research on neurophysiology, the pathophysiology of Parkinsons disease, and closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapies.
