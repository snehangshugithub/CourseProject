He joined UC Berkeley in July 2020. Research InterestsMy research focusses on using ideas from the theory behind quantum computers (and, more generally, quantum information) in order to make progress in our understanding of the quantum mechanics of gravity. In particular, I have recently been working on understanding how the information that falls into a black hole ends up being encoded in the Hawking radiation left behind after the black hole evaporates.
