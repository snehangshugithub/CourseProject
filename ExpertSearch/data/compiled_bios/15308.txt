Her primary focus is on metamaterials that manipulate the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.Litchinitser began her work with metamaterials as a research scientist at the University of Michigan, and joined the faculty at the University of Buffalo in 2008. Over the next decade, she became one of the leading experts in optical metamaterials. Currently, Litchinitsers research focuses on topological photonics, which seek to direct light around tight corners using tiny waveguides that prevent photons from scattering. She is Fellowof the American Physical Society (APS), a Fellowof the Optical Society of America (OSA),and a Senior Memberof the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
