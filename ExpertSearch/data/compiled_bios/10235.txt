Byrnes Professor of Engineering Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science Phone314-935-4869 OfficeJubel Hall, Room 103L smls@wustl.edu Lab website Education PhD, University of Toronto, 1974MEng, Indian Institute of Science, 1970BEng, Indian Institute of Science, 1968BS, Bangalore University, 1965 Expertise Conducts research within the Consortium for Clean Coal Utilization Focus Deformation and fracture of engineering materials, Materials Selection in Engineering Design, Damage tolerant biomimetic materials Biography As a visiting scientist at the Air Force Materials Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base from 1974 to 1976, Shankar Sastry was a key research investigator in the pioneering work of the development of titanium aluminides for high performance gas turbine engine applications. From 1977 to 1991, Professor Sastry worked at McDonnell Douglas Research Laboratories (MDRL) in St. Louis. As the group leader and program director of Metals and Composites research team at MDRL, Professor Sastry developed several high performance light weight alloys for aircraft applications. He introduced the use of super plastic forming processing maps for near net shape fabrication of aircraft structural components. For his contributions in the field of structural materials, Professor Sastry was honored with MDC Fellow Award in 1990. Professor Sastry has been a professor at Washington University since 1991. He is a member of the American Society for Metals, The Metallurgical Society (TMS), and the past chairman of the Mechanical Metallurgy and Physical Metallurgy Committees of TMS. Research Professor Sastry has over 33 years of experience in the development of high performance structural materials, rapidly solidified aluminum and titanium alloys, metal matrix composites, advanced solders, titanium aluminides, high temperature intermetallics and advanced materials processing. The current focus of his research group is to develop an integrated approach combining innovative low cost materials processing with ultralight high strength high modulus product for the fabrication of high performance aerospace and automotive structural components. With the objective of developing predictive capability for the selection of 'processing window' for optimum microstructural refinement and maximum property improvements, Finite element method based codes combined with recovery/recrystallization mechanism-based constitutive equations are used to simulate the materials processing by methods such as equal channel angular extrusion and determine microstructural refinements produced by such processes. The simulations are validated by experimental measurements using state-of-the art processing facilities. Professor Sastry has patents on advanced titanium composites, transient titanium alloys, titanium powder production, and explosively bonded superplastic aluminum alloys. He has been the principal investigator of several Air Force, Navy, NSF, DARPA, and NASA sponsored R & D Programs.
