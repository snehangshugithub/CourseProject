Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview I study the cellular physiology of the mammalian brain. Most of my work centers on the neocortex and the thalamus, which are responsible for thinking, remembering, processing sensory information, and controlling movement. The neocortex is a vast network of interconnected neurons. My research group studies the properties of these neurons, their synaptic connections, and the characteristics of cortical networks. We are also interested in the mechanisms of epileptic seizures and neurodevelopmental disorders. Research Statement The neocortex is the largest and most unique part of the mammalian brain. It generates neural events that are essential for normal perception, motor control, memory, and cognition. To help understand the mechanisms of the neocortex, my students and I study the basic physiology of its neurons, synapses and neurotransmitters, and the patterns of its connections. We discovered that inhibitory neurons in the cortex communicate via electrical synapses, and that electrically coupled networks of neurons can serve as pacemakers for cortical rhythms in the brain. We are also studying how neural activity leads to plasticity of cortical circuits, and how the seizure discharges of epilepsy begin and propagate through the cortex. Our methods include intracellular and extracellular recording and patch clamping, neuroanatomical techniques, isolated slice preparations, optogenetics, and computer modeling.
