Strathmann Richard R. Strathmann Richard R. Strathmann Professor Emeritus rrstrath@uw.edu 11-102 and106 FHL Not accepting graduate students Fields of interest Development, Evolution & Systematics, Marine Biology Research Biography Related news Relevant publications I am interested in why the beautiful and diverse patterns of development have evolved as they have instead of in other ways. Most of my research is on functional requirements and constraints for embryos, larvae, and juveniles of marine animals. Topics include parental protection and retention of embryos, extraembryonic nutrition, feeding and swimming of pelagic larvae, costs and benefits of dispersal, constraints on habitat selection, mortality, defenses, stasis and change in modes of development. My students' research has also included consequences of coloniality, constraints on mating by free spawners, and other topics. Resident Assoc. Director of the Friday Harbor Labs, UW, from 1973 to 2008. Also since 1973, on the faculty of the Zoology Department and now Biology Department at the UW to 2008.
