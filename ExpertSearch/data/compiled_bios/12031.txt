Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Biography I am a Professor in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Neural Engineering (NE) in CSEE and co-director of the Essex BCI-NE laboratory. I obtained a Dr.techn (PhD) degree in computer science from Graz University of Technology, Austria in 2008. My thesis was about enhancement of usability and practicality of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCIs. From 2008 to 2010 I was postdoctoral researcher at the Department for Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, USA. In 2010 I joined the Graz University of Technology again as Assistant Professor. I received my habilitation (venia docendi) and became Assistant Professor in 2016. From 2011 to 2018 I was deputy director of the Institute of Neural Engineering, home of the Graz-BCI laboratory. I joined the University of Essex in 2019. My primary research interests are in the areas of online brain-machine co-adaptation, statistical and adaptive signal processing, mobile brain and body imaging, and rehabilitation. Active research topics focus on gaining deeper insights into brain dynamics and mechanisms underlying motor and cognitive learning, with the goal of improving the interpretability of brain rhythms and thereby optimizing the performance of spontaneous EEG-based BCI interaction and rehabilitation protocols. Qualifications Dipl.-Ing. Dr.techn (PhD) Graz University of Technology, Diplom-Ingenieur Graz University of Technology, Appointments University of Essex Professor, School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex (1/1/2019 - present) Other academic Associate Professor, Neural Engineering, Graz University of Technology (1/9/2016 - 31/12/2018) Assistant Professor, Graz University of Technology (1/11/2011 - 31/8/2016) Postdoctoral research fellow, Department of Computer Science, University of Washington (1/5/2008 - 30/5/2010) Research Associate, University of Graz (1/10/2007 - 30/4/2008) Research and professional activities Research interests Brain-Computer Interfaces Thought-based interaction with the physical world - Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) translate brain signals directly into action. Motor activity is no longer required. Thoughts trigger actions. BCI research aims at providing physically disabled people communication tools that allow them to live an independent life and remain part of society. The primary goal of my research is to enhance usability and practicality of BCIs that detect changes in spontaneous noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms. Ultimate goal is the development of a reliable brain-switch signal that allows users 24/7 on-demand thought-based access to communication technologies. Using a BCI typically requires training. I am interested in optimizing human-machine interaction and in finding effective and efficient training paradigms. For both, human and machine. Key words: Brain-Computer Interface Open to supervise Statistical and adaptive signal processing Many applications, including brain-computer interfacing (BCI), require extracting relevant information from noisy signals and/or interpreting the uncertain information. I am interested in model based estimation methods for time-varying systems and in developing estimators/controllers where adaptive features are needed to handle uncertainties. Moreover, I am interested in transfer learning and findings stationary subspaces in multivariate data. Key words: signal processing Open to supervise Mobile brain and body imaging A more comprehensive knowledge of neuro-oscillatory mechanisms will lead to better understanding and interpretation of brain rhythms. To this end, it is essential to isolate specific behavior and study the related rhythms individually. It is, however, also important to study the brain behaving naturally in familiar environments. I am interested in studying the behaving brain in natural environment. Open to supervise Technology-mediated rehabilitation Directed and early rehabilitation after brain injury (e.g. stroke) aims at promoting neuroplasticity, i.e., inducing (sub)cortical reorganization for minimizing motor impairment. Long term rehabilitation significantly improves motor function. Some unique contributions of robotic therapy versus conventional therapies are that robots can be used as valuable adjuncts to save time and energy for the therapist, making rehabilitation sessions more efficient, and that rehabilitation protocols can be very precisely tailored to individual patients with only as much assistance provided as needed. I am interested in studying the interplay between therapeutic intervention, brain activity pattern and functional outcome for improving motor rehabilitation. Open to supervise Assistive technology | How can we help people with disabilities to perform tasks and activities of daily living independently? I am interested in developing novel human-machine interaction technology that support the disabled and allows regaining some degree of independence.
