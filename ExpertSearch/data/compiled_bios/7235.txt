Mechanical Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA B.S. Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, IndiaResearch InterestsPatankar group research is focused on four primary missions: First, to develop fully resolved computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques to simulate muscle activated movement of organisms (e.g. knifefish, zebrafish) and organs (e.g. esophagus). Second, to use theory and CFD to understand the neural control of movement, to design novel underwater vehicles, and to interrogate the evolution of fish form and function. Third, to establish the foundational science of controlling phase (anti-icing, anti-frosting, boiling, condensation, non-wetting supehydrophobic surfaces) using surface roughness and chemistry. Fourth, to establish new metrics to quantify the mileage efficiency and greenhouse emissions of automotive vehicles.Significant RecognitionInternational Conference on Multiphase Flow Junior Award, 2010 (presented once every three years for significant scientific breakthrough(s) in the field of multiphase flow by a researcher younger than 40 years) Defense Science Study Group member (one of fifteen scientists and engineers chosen nation-wide), 2010-2011 Associated Student Government Honor Roll for outstanding teaching (one of six chosen from the entire school of engineering), Northwestern University, 2009 Honorable mention McCormick Teacher of the Year, 2008 NSF CAREER Award, 2002 Searle Junior Fellowship, 2001, Searle Center for Teaching Excellence, Northwestern University Certificate of outstanding ability in mathematics (ranked 14th in India), 1988, Indian Mathematics Olympiad Association National talent scholarship, 1987, National Council for Education Research and Training, India Selected Publications1.

He has the EA3 course beginning from spring 2008. He has developed the following graduate courses: Introduction to CFD (ME 423), Advanced Topics in CFD (ME 424), and Design and Analysis of Microfluidic Systems (ME 421). His future course development effort will specifically focus on the hydrodynamics of aquatic locomotion (in the broad context of biology, evolution, neuromechanical modeling, underwater vehicle design, and animation), and on textured surfaces to tune wetting behavior.
