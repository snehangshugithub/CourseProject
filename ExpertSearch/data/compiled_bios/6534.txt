Before joining the William E. Boeing Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics in the summer of 2013, he was an Assistant Professor in Mechanical Engineering and an interim Program Director of Aerospace Program at the University of South Carolina (2011-2013). He was a postdoctoral research scholar at Caltech (2009-2011) and also has industrial experience in product development as a senior engineer at Samsung Electronics (2006-2009).His research has been directed towards developing advanced structures and sensing systems for aerospace, mechanical, and biomedical applications. To achieve this goal, he employs novel engineered materials and architectures (e.g., nonconventional composite materials and metamaterials) that offer enhanced degrees of freedom in controlling the mechanical response of structures. Based on the understanding of the mechanics and dynamics of these media, his research aims at designing a new class of lightweight and intelligent structures with tailored mechanical characteristics and sensing capabilities. His research has been featured in news media, such as Reuters, NSF News, and U.S. Public Broadcasting Service, and he has received the NSF CAREER, University of South Carolinas Rising Star, and Samsung Think Tank Team Awards.
