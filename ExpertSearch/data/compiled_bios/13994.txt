His work includes motion models for snakes and snake robots and development of fundamental mathematical tools for the study of locomotion. Personal Research Site: rosslhatton.com Biography: Ross L. Hatton is an associateprofessor of Robotics and Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State University, where he directs the Laboratory for Robotics and Applied Mechanics (LRAM). He received his Ph.D. and M.S. degrees from Carnegie Mellon University and an SB from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His research focuses on understanding the fundamental mechanics of locomotion and sensory perception, making advances in mathematical theory accessible to an engineering audience, and on finding abstractions that facilitate human control of unconventional locomotors. Hattons research group also works with local industry to transfer modern developments in robotics from the lab to the factory or into commercial production. Dr. Hatton is a 2017 recipient of an NSF CAREER Award. Selected Publications: Nonconservativity and Noncommutativity in Locomotion Ross L. Hatton and Howie Choset.
