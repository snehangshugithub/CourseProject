His website is High Temperature Materials Laboratory which details the publications, presentations and research equipment. Standing out among his many important contributions is his elucidation of the tension-compression asymmetry in nickel-titanium shape memory alloys undergoing reversible phase transformations. He explained both the role of plasticity and crystallographic texture on the shape memory response and the relaxation of elastic energy leading to hysteresis in this class of materials. Using atomistic simulations, Professor Sehitoglu developed a first principles model for determining the twin nucleation stress. Among his current research efforts are several projects supported by the National Science Foundation, including investigations of power generation from magneto shape memory effects, linking deformation length scales in transforming materials, on which he is collaborating with scholars in Italy, the design of high nitrogen steels, twinning in metals and high temperature shape memory alloys. He is also examining nitrogen effects in Hadfield steel, grain size effects in nitrogen, thin structures and hydrogen embrittlement, and he is a research partner in the Midwest Structural Sciences Center. Professor Sehitoglu is the Director of the Fracture Control Program (FCP). The FCP works cooperatively with industrial partners to develop models for fatigue and fracture, and enhances the impact of externally funded basic research by transferring all findings to FCP sponsors through advisory meetings and short courses, attended each year by more than 100 engineers, designers and scientists.
