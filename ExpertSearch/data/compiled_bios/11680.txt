He received his Ph.D. inBiophysicsfromUCSFin 2009. There, he worked inKevan Shokatslab studying the role of PI3K signaling ininsulin response,cancer, anddrug resistance. Eli did his postdoc inGarry Nolanslab atStanford University. There, he developed acell barcoding methodformass cytometrythat he used to studykinase inhibitor specificity across the human immune system, developed a graph-based mapping algorithm totrack iPS cell reprogrammingandidentify early reprogramming intermediates, and applied these generalizable methods to mapAML patient samples by prognosisandorganism-level organization of the mouse immune system. In January 2016, Eli began his independent career as an Assistant Professor in theDepartment of Biomedical Engineeringat theUniversity of Virginia.

Google Scholar Courses Taught BME 2104 Cell and Molecular Biology for Engineers BME 6550 Stem Cell Engineering Featured Grants & Projects In Vitro Differentiation Research Research in our laboratory is focused on discovering the mechanisms that control stem cell fate. We study in vitro differentiation to gain insight into stem cell behavior during normal development and disease, and we study in vivo development to gain insight into the derivation of clinically relevant cell types for regenerative therapy. In order to study the complex mixtures of rapidly changing cell types that exist in these in vitro and in vivo systems, we are building experimental and computational tools that track cell populations as they change over time with molecular characterization at the single-cell level. Using these tools, our goal is to define the fundamental principles of cellular pluripotency and differentiation.
