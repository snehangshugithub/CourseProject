Wong Assistant Professor of Biology Harikesh S. Wong studies how intercellular communication controls the immune response in tissues. wonghs@mit.edu Email Education PhD, 2016, University of Toronto BSc, 2010, Biochemistry, McMaster University Research Summary Immune cells communicate across multiple scales in time and space, forming intercellular circuits that promote or impede the immune response. We employ distinct quantitative fluorescence microscopy methods, computational modeling, and experimental perturbations to study these circuits and their emergent behaviors within intact tissue environments. Ultimately, we seek to understand how imbalanced immune cell communication due to genetic or environmental variation results in detrimental host outcomes, including pathogen dissemination, autoimmunity, and tumorigenesis.
