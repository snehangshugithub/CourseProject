Steiner Professor of Immunology Emerita Before closing her lab, Lisa A. Steiner analyzed the zebrafish genome to understand white blood cells and their role in the immune system. 617-253-6704 Phone 68-623 Office Education Postdoctoral training with Michael Sela, Herman Eisen, and Rodney Porter MD, 1959, Yale School of Medicine MA, 1956, Mathematics, Radcliffe College BA, 1954, Mathematics, Swarthmore College Research Summary Lisa Steiner explored the range of structural variation among antibodies in vertebrate species. The variation observed demonstrates that effective antibodies, while sharing certain basic features such as variable and constant regions, can be unexpectedly diverse in structure, varying in number of polypeptide chains or in pattern of disulfide bridging. Moreover, the polypeptide chains in non-mammalian vertebrates do not generally fall into classifications developed for mammalian antibodies, such as kappa, lambda, gamma, etc. Francois Jacob has called such variability evolutionary tinkering. Lisa Steiner is no longer accepting students. Key PublicationsExpression of zebrafish rag genes during early development identifies the thymus. Willett, CE, Zapata, AG, Hopkins, N, Steiner, LA. 1997.
