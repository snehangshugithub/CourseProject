I mainly work on a range of topics centered on quasars and supermassive black holes (SMBHs), to understand the physics and evolution of these exotic objects in the cosmological context. Specifically, I work on the large-scale structure traced by quasars, the demography of SMBHs as a function of cosmic time, the phenomenology and physics of black hole accretion, and the co-evolution of black holes and host galaxies. I use multi-wavelength survey data and dedicated observing programs to carry out these studies.

Light Echos in Faraway GalaxiesA team led by Illinois astronomers Qian Yang (postdoctoral researcher), Prof. Yue Shen and Prof. Xin Liu discover the longest echos from the heart of faraway galaxies. Read more about it ... Shen Promoted to Associate ProfessorProfessor Yue Shen has been promoted to Associate Professor of Astronomy. Congratulations, Yue! Astronomy Professors use the Dark Energy Survey for New Discoveries The Dark Energy Survey recently finished with observations (taken over 6 years and cataloging hundreds of millions ofgalaxies), and Illinois astronomers (including Profs. Athol Kemball, Xin Liu, Paul Ricker, Yue Shen, and Joaquin Vieira) are using this large data for new exciting science results,... Prof. Yue Shen Selected as a 2016 Alfred P. Sloan Research FellowYue Shen, an assistant professor of astronomy and a faculty affiliate at NCSA has been named a Sloan Research Fellow for 2016. Yue is an observational astronomer who has built a broad and prolific research program featuring observational and theoretical studies of supermassive black holes.
