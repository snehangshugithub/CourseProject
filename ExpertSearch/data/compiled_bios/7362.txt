B.S., Mathematics and Electrical Engineering, Bogazici University, Turkey, 1996. Research Interests My research interests mainly center around efficient digital representations of analog signals. This subject draws on sampling theory in signal processing and harmonic analysis as well as quantization theory in information theory. I have worked extensively on the approximation power of sigma-delta modulation schemes in the classical setting of bandlimited functions. Recently I have been involved in building a quantization theory for compressive sampling. Selected Publications I. Daubechies, R. DeVore, M. Fornasier, and C.
