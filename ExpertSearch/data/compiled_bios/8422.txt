Environmental Engineering Lehigh University, 2005 M.S. Environmental Engineering Lehigh University, 2007 Ph.D. Civil Engineering The University of Texas at Austin, 2011 ResearchInterests The occurrence, fate, transport, and toxicity of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and hormones, in natural and engineered systems; and, The recovery of vital resources, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, from municipal and agricultural waste streams to improve water quality and ensure sustainable development. Our research projects on contaminants of emerging concern relate to the following topics: Investigation of pharmaceuticals, personal care products, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, hormones, organometallic chemicals, and other CECs in the aquatic environment; Development of advanced analytical methods (e.g., liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD), fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs)) to measure CECs and characterize DOM in environmental samples; Pretreatment of environmental samples by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) protocols; Environmental occurrence of CECs in water, soil, sediment, and tissue; Transformation of CECs in drinking water treatment, wastewater treatment, and water reuse; Degradation of CECs in photochemical, photocatalytic, and oxidation systems; and, Application of cell-based assays to measure antimicrobial, estrogenic, and other pharmacological activity of water samples containing CECs. Our research projects on resource recovery relate to the following topics: Development of innovative technologies to recover nutrients (e.g., phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium) from animal manure, urine, and municipal wastewater; The Phosphorus Extraction and Recovery System (PEARS) Nutrient Extraction and Recovery Devices (NERDs) Application of Donnan dialysis for selective uptake, recovery, and treatment of inorganic chemicals; Investigation of natural coagulants for improved recovery of struvite-based fertilizers from waste streams; and, Construction of pilot-scale reactors to evaluate mass balance and economic viability of novel resource recovery technologies.
