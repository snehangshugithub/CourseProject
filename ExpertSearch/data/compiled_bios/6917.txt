Current work brings together aspects of molecular genetics, biochemistry, ecology, genomics andcomputational biology. Of particular interest to us arethe factors that limit the rate of adaptive evolutionary changeandthe extent towhich the genetic basis of organismal phenotypic diversity is predictable.We address these fundamental questions at a variety ofscales, from the dissection of repeated adaptation in a single protein (Na+,K+-ATPase) to the characterization of changes in gene regulatorynetworks underlying phenotypes like pigmentation and morphology to inferences about processes underlying genome evolution andspeciation. To these ends, my group uses model and non-model organisms including taxa as diverse as insects, fish, reptiles and amphibiansand employs state-of-the-art computational and functional genomics tools, including DNA/RNA sequencing and genome editing technologies.
