She joined Cornell in 1989, and was Chair of the Department of Computer Science 2006-2010. She has been elected to the National Academy of Engineering, National Academy of Sciences, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, is an external member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and is the recipient of a number of fellowships and awards including the the IEEE John von Neumann Medal, Packard Fellowship, the Gdel Prize, Dantzig Prize, and the Fulkerson Prize. She was editor editor-in-Chief of SIAM Journal of Computing 2004-2009, and is currently editor-in-Chief of the Journal of the ACM, and editor of some other journals includingthe Theory of Computing, and Combinatorica.Research InterestsTardos's research interest is algorithms and algorithmic game theory, an area concerned with designing and analyzing systems and algorithms for selfish users. Her research focuses on algorithms and games on networks. She is most known for her work on network-flow algorithms, approximation algorithms, and quantifying the efficiency of selfish routing.Theory of ComputationAlgorithmsMarket DesignInformation Technology ModelingOptimizationSelected PublicationsThodoris Lykouris, Karthik Sridharan, and Eva Tardos. 2018.
