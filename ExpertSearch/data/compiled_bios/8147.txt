Biography Teppei Yamamoto is the Alfred Henry and Jean Morrison Hayes Career Development Associate Professor of Political Science at MIT. He obtained a BA in Liberal Arts from the University of Tokyo (2006) and an MA (2008) and PhD (2011) in Politics from Princeton University, where he received a Charlotte Elizabeth Procter Fellowship for the year of 2010 to 2011. His doctoral dissertation won the John T. Williams Dissertation Prize in 2010 from the Society for Political Methodology. He is broadly interested in developing quantitative methods for political science research, with particular focus on causal inference and experimental design. His research has appeared in various journals such as American Journal of Political Science and American Political Science Review. Research Professor Yamamoto is broadly interested in the development of quantitative methods for political science data. His research has focused on statistical methods for causal inference, including causal attribution, causal mediation, causal moderation, and causal inference with measurement error. I also study experimental designs and survey methodology, with empirical applications to elections and comparative political behavior.
