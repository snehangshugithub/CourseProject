Mahowald Director of Graduate Studies for Atmospheric Sciences Earth and Atmospheric Sciences 2112 Snee Hall 607/255-5166 Irving Porter Church Professor in Engineering mahowald@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyProfessor Mahowald has undergraduate degrees in German and physics from Washington University, an M.S. in natural resource policy from the University of Michigan, and a Ph.D. in meteorology from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mahowald conducted her postdoctoral research at Stockholm University in Sweden prior to holding a faculty position at the University of California, Santa Barbara from 1998-2002. She then spent five years as a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) before joining Cornell as a faculty member in 2007.Research InterestsMy research group is focused on understanding feedbacks in the earth system that impact climate change. This includes global and regional scale atmospheric transport of biogeochemically important species such as desert dust, as well as the carbon cycle. We look at these issues through a combination of 3-dimensional global transport and climate models, as well as analysis of satellite and in situ data.Biomedical EngineeringEnergy and the EnvironmentEarth and Atmospheric ScienceEarth System ScienceClimate and PaleoclimateMeteorology and Applied ClimatologyBiogeochemistry and Climate InteractionsAtmospheric Science and ClimateTeaching InterestsClimate change, atmospheric biogeochemistry, modelingSelected PublicationsMahowald, Natalie M., Douglas S.
