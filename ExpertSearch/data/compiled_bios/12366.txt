Ludwig Scholar for Cancer Research David Housman studies the biological underpinnings of diseases like Huntingtons, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. 617-253-3013 Phone 76-553 Office dhousman@mit.edu Email Lab Website Elizabeth Galoyan Assistant 617-253-3016 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1971, Brandeis University BS, 1966, Biology, Brandeis University Research Summary We use genetic approaches to identify the molecular basis of human disease pathology. More specifically, we develop strategies to combat three major disease areas: cancer, trinucleotide repeat disorders like Huntingtons disease, and cardiovascular disease.
