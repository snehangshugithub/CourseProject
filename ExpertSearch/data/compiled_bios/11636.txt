She has also been conducting research in the areas of intelligent and autonomous robotic systems, innovative mechanisms and controls for automation, space robotics/small satellites, manufacturing and micro-electro-mechanical systems. She has theoretical and experimental expertise in dynamics and controls of flexible multibody systems; system identification; design and control of robots using intelligent, event-driven, and physics-based modeling techniques; sensor-enabled dynamic (active) fixturing for micro/mesoscale manufacturing systems; system automation; modeling and design of MEMS devices; and design, path-planning, dynamics and control of reconfigurable, cooperative multi-robotic systems. Her research is/has been supported by Lockheed Martin Corporation, DARPA, NSF, NASA, SNL, Hammond Machinery, Inc., Harris Corporation, PhaseSpace Corp., and others. In 2010, Professor Wiens served as a National Research Council supported Senior Research Associate at the AFRL/RVSV-Kirtland AFB conducting research on small satellite telescopes integrating the design of the deployable structures (mechanisms) with the optics. In 2013-2015, Professor Wiens was the ASME Foundation Swanson Fellow/AAAS Fellow. As fellow, she was appointed to the Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office (AMNPO/NIST) as the Assistant Director for Research Partnerships responsibilities included chairing Interagency Working Team for planning and coordination of federal advanced manufacturing activities and policy documents, providing coordination for the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership 2.0 (sub-committee of the U.S. Presidents Council of Advisors on Science and Technology), and staff support for the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) subcommittee on Advanced Manufacturing. In 2016, she was awarded the United States Department of Commerce, Certificate of Appreciation from Secretary Penny Pritzker. In 2016-2017, Professor Wiens served as the FloridaMakes Director of Advanced Manufacturing BRIDG.
