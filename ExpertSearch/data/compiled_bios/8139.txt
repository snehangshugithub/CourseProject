Biography Andrea Louise Campbell is the Arthur and Ruth Sloan Professor of Political Science. Professor Campbell's interests include American politics, political behavior, public opinion, and political inequality, particularly their intersection with social welfare policy, health policy, and tax policy. She is the author of "Trapped in America's Safety Net: One Family's Struggle" University of Chicago Press, 2014, How Policies Make Citizens: Senior Citizen Activism and the American Welfare State (Princeton, 2003) and, with Kimberly J. Morgan, The Delegated Welfare State: Medicare, Markets, and the Governance of Social Provision (Oxford, 2011). Her research has appeared in the American Political Science Review, Political Behavior, Comparative Political Studies, Politics & Society, Studies in American Political Development, and Health Affairs, among others. She holds an AB degree from Harvard and a PhD from UC Berkeley. Her research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Russell Sage Foundation. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Social Insurance and served on the National Academy of Sciences Commission on the Fiscal Future of the United States. Research Professor Campbell's research examines the relationship between public policies and public opinion and political behavior. Her first book, How Policies Make Citizens, uses a case study of Social Security and senior citizens to explore and illustrate policy feedback effects and mass publics how policies create constituencies and how those constituencies shape subsequent policy outcomes. Her second book with Kimberly Morgan, The Delegated Welfare State, utilizes a case study of Medicare, from its inception through the prescription drug reform of 2003 (with an afterword on the Obama health reform) to examine the causes and consequences of delegation of social welfare programs to non-state actors (to non-profits, to for-profit firms, and ultimately to consumer themselves in market model programs such as Medicare Part D drug plans). A third book, Trapped in Americas Safety Net: One Familys Struggle, grew out of her April 2012 New York Times op-ed piece (cited by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in her Affordable Care Act opinion) and uses her familys experience to illustrate how American means-tested social programs work on the ground. Professor Campbell is currently working on a fourth major project examining the interplay between policy and public opinion in the development and politics of American taxation over time.
