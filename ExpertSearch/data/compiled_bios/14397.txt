Zavattieri's research interests lie at the interface between Solid Mechanics and Materials Engineering with focus on the development of novel materials that exhibit paradigm-shifting properties for various applications that can impact the general field of infrastructure and lightweight structural materials. His contribution to solid mechanics has been focused on the structure-function relationship of advanced materials at multiple length-scales, combining state-of-the-art computational techniques and experiments to characterize the properties, and enabling the design of novel materials. His early work on micromechanical models for materials has provided a robust framework for combined computational/experimental investigations of polycrystalline materials. His contribution to fracture mechanics includes the development of a new fracture models for thin-walled structures and their implementation in commercial finite element codes. He also made contributions in the area of smart materials, structures and smart composites (with a total of 10 patents and 5 other published patent applications). He has recently worked on solid mechanics problems related to biological and biomimetic materials. He pioneered the use of the 3D printing technology for the fabrication of scaled-up biomimetic composites and its combination with theoretical/computational models and experiments to unveil the most important toughening mechanisms found in some of most impact resistant natural materials. His most recent work is focused on architectured metamaterials, smart and programmable materials.
