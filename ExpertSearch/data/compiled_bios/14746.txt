The primary weapon in our toolbox is visualization we think seeing is not only believing, but also the first step to understanding. We combine novel techniques in microscopy, synchrotron X-ray, and neutron imaging to discover cool and fundamental phenomena. We are passionate about mitigating the rapidly-accelerating global climate change, caused in large part by anthropogenic carbon emissions. The goal of our research, therefore, is to aid the development of practical, impactful technologies capable of significantly reducing the carbon emissions of our energy systems. Our current research on climate change mitigation focuses on technologies such as geological carbon dioxide sequestration and renewable energy storage via electrolysis. We are additionally interested in understanding the impact of climate change on the hydrologic system, and how our society can adapt to minimize the associated damages. Our current research on climate change adaptation focuses on problems such as water infiltration and seawater intrusion under climate change. Education B.A.Sc.
