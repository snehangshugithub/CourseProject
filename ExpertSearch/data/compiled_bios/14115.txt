Jin received his B.A. in Integrated Science and B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering from Northwestern University. Afterward, Jin went to obtain his Sc.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from MIT, where his research focused on finding a structure-property relation that controls the electrochemical activity of transition metal oxides and nanoparticles for fuel cells, electrolyzers, and metal-air batteries. Jin conducted his postdoctoral fellowship at the Harvard University Center for the Environment. There, he worked on understanding the light-matter interaction in titanium oxides and the role of non-equilibrium structure on the surface chemistry and the carrier lifetimes. His interest is in developing rational strategies for designing new materials for energy and environmental applications.Research InterestsOur group focuses on identifying design strategies based on optics and electronic structure engineering to discover new materials and devices for sustainable energy and environmental technologies. Ongoing efforts in our group include: Electrocatalysts and photocatalysts from transition metal oxide heterostructures, in situ spectroscopy on catalytic and photocatalytic surfaces, nanophotonics for environmental sensing, pollution detection, and toxin deactivation.Advanced MaterialsEnergy SystemsEnergy and the EnvironmentSurface ScienceSensors and ActuatorsNanotechnologySelected PublicationsKuo, Ding-Yuan, Jason K.
