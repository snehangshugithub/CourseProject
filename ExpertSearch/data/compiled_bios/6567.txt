Hord Jr. Professor Thrust Area Specialty: Energy Engineering and Science 114U Randolph Hall (0710) 460 Old Turner Street Blacksburg, VA 24061 vonspako@vt.edu (540) 231-6684 Research Interests Theoretical and applied non-equilibrium and equilibrium thermodynamics with two principal focuses: i) intrinsic quantum thermodynamics (IQT) and its mathematical framework steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEA-QT) and ii) SEA non-equilibrium thermodynamics (SEA-NT) Thermoeconomics / exergo-environomics / exergy analysis: computational methods for modeling and optimizing complex energy systems; methodological approaches (with and without sustainability and uncertainty considerations) for the integrated synthesis, design, operation, control, reliability, and resiliency of energy systems; decomposition approaches for large-scale optimization Heat, mass, and charge transport Kinetic theory, the Boltzmann equation, and its master equations (e.g., the BGK equation) Numerical Modeling: macroscopic (i.e., finite element and finite difference approaches applied to the continuum conservation equations), mesoscopic (i.e., Lattice Boltzmann Method applied to the BGK equation and the SEA-NT equation of motion), atomistic (i.e., closed form and discretized solutions of the energy eigenvalue problem and discretized solutions of the IQT/SEA-QT equations of motion) Renewable and non-renewable stationary power/cogeneration/district heating-cooling systems; infrastructure systems (e.g., grid/microgrid/producer/storage networks) Fuel cell applications for both transportation and centralized, distributed, and portable power generation and cogeneration. High performance (supersonic and hypersonic) and uninhabited air vehicles Nanoscale and microscale reactive and non-reactive systems Center for Energy Systems Research Publications See Dr. von Spakovsky's publications and research on Google Scholar.
