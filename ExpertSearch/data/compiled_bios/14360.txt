Many proposed innovations in areas that could mitigate these issues (e.g. membrane separations, energy storage and conversion) will require the ability to create nanomaterials with unprecedented structural and compositional control. The future development of these technologies will require both an increased understanding of the behavior of molecules in these technologies and novel tools that can rapidly produce previously unsynthesizable materials. In the Bergsman Research Group, we enable the use of new technologies in the water-energy nexus by using atomic layer processing tools, which can be used to create previously unrealized nanomaterials in membrane separations and catalytic energy conversion that demand precise interfacial control. We also use advanced characterization methods and high-throughput synthesis to quickly screen promising materials candidates and answer fundamental questions about the thermodynamics, kinetics, and transport behavior in these systems.
