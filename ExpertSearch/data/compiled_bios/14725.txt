Innovation Center550 Assembly Street, Suite 1300Office 1311Columbia, SC 29208 Background Ph.D., Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico M.Sc., Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico B.Sc., Electrical Engineering, Catholic University, Asuncion Dr. Crichigno joined the Integrated Information Technology (IIT) Department at the University of South Carolina (USC) in January, 2018. Before coming to USC, Dr. Crichigno was a faculty member in the College of Engineering and Technology at Northern New Mexico College. Dr. Crichigno has also served as a research associate at the Electrical Engineering Department at University of South Florida and at the Florida Center for Cybersecurity since 2016. Dr. Crichigno's research is focused on practical implementation of Science DMZs. This includes the design and implementation of high-speed switched networks, TCP optimization, and experimental evaluation of congestion control algorithms such as BBR, HTCP, and Cubic. His work has been funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other agencies. In this regard, he has led the design, development, and testing of a 10 Gbps Science DMZ in New Mexico. Dr. Crichignos work also includes the development of material for teaching and research in computer networks and cybersecurity. He is the Principal Investigator of the NSF-funded project Building a Cybersecurity Pipeline through Experiential Virtual Labs and Workforce Alliances. The projects goals are: 1) to develop scalable and replicable virtual laboratory experiences for cybersecurity education; 2) to create an internship program in alliance with the private sector and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), in efforts to bolster national security.
