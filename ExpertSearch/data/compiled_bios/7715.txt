Mitchell is professor emeritus at UCLA Anderson School of Management and the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, where he chaired the Department of Policy Studies in 199697. Mitchell was formerly director of the UCLA Institute for Research on Labor and Employment (197990) and continues to serve on the Institute's advisory committee. During Phase II of the federal wage/price controls program of the early 1970s, Mitchell was chief economist of the Pay Board, the agency that administered wage controls. He was twice associated with the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., including a stint as a senior fellow in the economic studies program (197879), and participated in several Brookings-sponsored research projects. His professional activities have included memberships and committee responsibilities on the executive boards of the Labor and Employment Relations Association (both national and Southern California), the North American Economics and Finance Association and the Institute of Industrial Relations Association. Mitchell is a past president of the North American Economics and Finance Association. In 2007 he was named a distinguished fellow of this association, now known as the International Banking, Economics, and Finance Association. Mitchell has also served on the nominating committee of the American Economic Association and on the editorial boards of various academic journals. He was co-editor of the journal Industrial Relations for many years. Currently, Mitchell edits the annual California Policy Options volumes and contributes a chapter each year on the California state budget. Mitchell regularly served as a member of the Human Resource Forecast Panel while it operated at the Conference Board and, later, at UCLA. He is a member of the International Industrial Relations Association and chairs one of its study groups (Pay Systems). At UCLA, he was co-director and then director (19992000) of the UCLA Anderson Business Forecasting Project. As a faculty member at UCLA, he has created the course California Policy Issues (now co-taught with former presidential candidate and Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis), now a core course of the minor in public policy. Mitchell received an Excellence in Education award in 2006 from the Labor and Employment Relations Association. Mitchell has served as a consultant to the Congressional Budget Office, the Federal Reserve Board, the President's Council on Wage and Price Stability, the U.S. Department of Labor and the International Labour Organisation. He is neutral chair of the board that oversees the health plans of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1277. Mitchell's past publications are generally in the areas of wage determination, wage-price controls, concession bargaining, flexible pay plans, non-wage employee benefits, use of labor-market data, labor standards in international trade and other aspects of labor-market analysis. He now focuses on California policy issues, especially state finance. He is part of a team developing an online network and website to foster research in the employment area, known as the Employment Policy Research Network. Mitchell is the author of Pensions, Politics, and the Elderly: Historic Social Movements and Their Lessons for Our Aging Society (M.E. Sharpe, 2000). The book uses California's colorful experience with "pensionite" movements among the state's seniors during the period from the 1920s through the 1940s to draw implications for the upcoming retirement of the baby boom. In 2007, Mitchell received the Excellence in Education Award from the Labor and Employment Relations Association. He lives in Santa Monica, California, with his wife Alice. They have two adult children. Education Ph.D. Economics, 1968, Massachusetts Institute of Technology A.B. Economics, 1964, Columbia University Published Papers Published Papers Daniel J.B.
