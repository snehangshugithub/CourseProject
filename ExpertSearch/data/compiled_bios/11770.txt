My research focuses on advancing our fundamental understanding and predictive capabilities of the simultaneous flow of two or more fluids through rocks, soils and other porous materials. Research in my group combines theory, simulation and experiments that elucidate fundamental aspects of multi-fluid flow, which we then apply for prediction of large-scale Earth science problems in the areas of energy and the environment, including geological carbon sequestration, methane hydrates, and ecohydrology of arid environments.Teaching Interests1.035 Structural and Soil Mechanics1.72 Groundwater Hydrology1.723 Computational Methods for Flow in Porous Media1.724s Carbon Capture and Storage: Science, Technology and PolicyAwards and Honors2012 Department of Energy Award for Outstanding Contributions in Geoscience2010 Department of Energy Early Career Award2010 Plenary speaker, Gordon Research Conference on Natural Gas Hydrates2008 ARCO Professorship in Energy Studies2007 Gilbert W.
