My primary work takes place at the Institute for Modeling Plasmas, Atmospheres, and Cosmic DusT (IMPACT, http://impact.colorado.edu ), where we have several parallel experimental and modeling efforts related to plasma/surface interactions at airless bodies, the evolution of planetary surfaces, the dynamics of cosmic dust, the physics of hypervelocity impacts... tobin.munsat@colorado.edu (303) 735-5596 Jeanne Nijhowne Graduate Program Assistant Physics Department contact for the graduate program and graduate faculty appointments. jeanne.nijhowne@colorado.edu (303) 735-0519 Michael Ritzwoller Professor Chair Director - Center for Imaging the Earth's Interior (CIEI) Physics Research Interests: Professor Ritzwoller is an observational seismologist. His early work was mainly in normal mode seismology and helioseismology. Research in the last decade has concentrated on developing methods to focus seismic models derived from surface wave dispersion information to tectonic scales, particularly in the US and China. Recent emphasis has focused on developing methods for exploiting ambient noise and earthquakes in surface wave tomography and combining this information to... michael.ritzwoller@colorado.edu Chair's Office: (303) 492-0297 Faculty Office: (303) 492-7075 Lindsey Romero Front Desk Coordinator Physics Main contact for the physics front office, room calendar scheduling, building proctor, key/swipe card liaison and room access, scheduling for Chairs appointments, textbook submission and desk copy ordering, colloquium coordinator, Commons and Reading Room rentals, backup for undergraduate program assistant Lindsey.Romero@colorado.edu (303) 492-6952 Paul Beale Professor Associate Chair - Alumni Relations Physics Research Interests: Theoretical Physics, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics of condensed matter systems: exact calculations involving the two-dimensional Ising model, solid-liquid transitions in systems of small molecules, thermodynamic integration methods and their applications to equilibrium solids and grain boundary kinetics, phase transitions in systems of particles with soft repulsive interactions, mean-field theories of liquid crystal systems.
