Her multi-disciplinary research blends nanophotonics, plasmonics, electronics, thermodynamics and mechanics. Svetlana makes smart fabrics that provide thermal comfort indoors and outdoors and stay clean no matter what, new meta-materials that exhibit color without any dyes or pigments and change it in response to external stimuli, and novel solar harvesting platforms that can provide clean energy and fresh water to off-electrical-grid and disaster-stricken communities. She is the author and co-author of more than 115 peer-reviewed papers, several award-winning courses, and multiple patens. Svetlana is a passionate advocate for science education and science public communication, which she supports via leadership in professional science organizations, conferences, and journal editorial boards, mentorship of student groups, and public outreach.
