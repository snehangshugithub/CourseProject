Personal profile Research interestsI currently work in the area of semiconductor technology, predominantly in the area of group III-V optoelectronics. A major focus of my work has been the creation of optoelectronic devices based on the group III-nitride wide bandgap semiconductor materials. I have experience in MOVPE semiconductor growth, alongside micro and nanofabrication for the creation of light-emitting and laser diodes. Recently, I have been exploring semiconductor crystal growth on three-dimensional, patterned substrates; understanding how the substrate affects the growth process. This has led to an extensive study of core-shell light-emitting diodes; primarily emitting in the visible regime, but also more recently in the ultraviolet. As a result of needing large area nanopatterning for creating growth templates, I also have expertise in nanoimprint lithography (NIL), electron beam lithography (EBL) and displacement Talbot lithography (DTL).
