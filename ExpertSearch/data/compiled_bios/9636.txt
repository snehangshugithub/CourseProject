Zipfel Associate Professor Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering Weill Hall, Room B41 607/255-0663wrz2@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyWarren Zipfel's research focus is on the development and application of optical microscopy for biomedical research and for clinical imaging applications using nonlinear microscopy, endoscopy and laparoscopy. The biological research focus in his lab is in the area of optical detection of cancer, and collaborative studies in cancer biology using transgenic mouse models of ovarian, mammary and prostate cancer. He serves as Director of the Developmental Resource for Biophysical Imaging and Optoelectronics (DRBIO), the NIH-funded center that originally developed multiphoton imaging in 1990. The Zipfel lab is also involved in numerous optical instrumentation development projects and the creation of new bioanalytical methods for studies in cell signaling and regulation.Research InterestsBiomedical Imaging and InstrumentationBioengineeringNanobio ApplicationsBiomedical EngineeringImage AnalysisBiophysicsSelected PublicationsLukk, T., R E.
