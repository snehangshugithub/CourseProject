Among recent highlights are the discovery of many new pulsars, including millisecond and binary pulsars, with detailed follow-up observations, by graduate students F. Camilo, R. Sayer, and J. Shrauner; former students Z. Arzoumanian (now at Cornell), V. Kaspi (Caltech), and D. J. Nice (National Radio Astronomy Observatory), and professors Taylor and Thorsett. The state of this art is such that finding each pulsar for the first time is in some ways much more difficult than studying it, after the discovery. However, it's the subsequent observations that yield the important results---which have spanned a wide range of topics in gravitational physics, stellar evolution, cosmology, fundamental astrometry, and time-keeping metrology. Most of these applications have been pioneered by the pulsar group at Princeton. Selected Publications "Discovery of Two Fast-Rotating Pulsars," Camilo, F., Nice, D. J., and Taylor, J.
