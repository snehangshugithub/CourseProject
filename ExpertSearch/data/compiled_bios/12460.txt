Her previous projects include: modeling the developing heart, understanding how the shape of bat ears influences their sonar patterns, 3D sketching, and interfaces for 3D medical image segmentation. Biography Cindy Grimm is an Professor in theSchool of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering at Oregon State University. She is affiliated with theRoboticsgroup,Human-Centeredcomputing, andGraphics and Visualization.Her background is in computer science, specifically computer graphics and surface modeling. However, over the years she has delved into human computer interfaces, surface modeling for biological applications, bat sonar, art-based rendering, 3D sketching, and understanding how people perform 3D segmentation of volumetric data.She received her PhD from Brown University in 1995 in the area of surface modeling, spent two years working at Microsoft Research on facial animation, then ten years as faculty in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis.
