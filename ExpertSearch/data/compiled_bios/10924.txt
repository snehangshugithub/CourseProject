Research interests Myresearch interestslie mainly in areas of string theory and quantum gravity. You can read more about the scientific vision in a broader context at our QMAP pages, here. Much of my past work has been set in the context of the gauge/gravity duality and black holes (see here for a 2017 public talk wherein I share my fascination with black holes). More recently, I have been focusing on the fascinating connections to quantum information theory, in particular on the relation between entanglement structure and emergence of dual spacetime. You can find most of my papers using the inSPIRE HEP search engine, in the followingpublication list. For more details and links to my online talks, please visit myResearchpages. Teaching and outreach In the 2020/21 academic year, Iwill teach: Phy 9HA: Classical Mechanics Phy 9HB: Special Relativity & Thermal Physics Phy 150: Special Topics (Black Holes) Phy 233: Topics in Geometry and Physics For a list of my previous courses, summer school lectures, and public talks, please see myTeachingpages.
