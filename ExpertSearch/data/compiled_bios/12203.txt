I also lecture for UW's Information School, teaching classes on data science and machine learning at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Broadly, my research interests are in using large-scale, high-dimensional data to improve educational policy and systems. I completed my PhD from UW's Information School with my dissertation focusing on how post-secondary institutions can better leverage their data.
