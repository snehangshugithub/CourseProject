Chemical Physics University of Reading, UK "My research expands the frontiers of materials science by designing, making, testing and modeling materials, coatings and microarchitectured structures to reduce the environmental impact of engineering systems." Haydn N. Wadley, University Professor HAYDN N. G. WADLEY is a University Professor and the Edgar A. Starke Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Virginia. He has broad interests in materials science, composite materials, micromechanics and thermal transport. His current research explores high temperature thermal and environmental coatings systems, microarchitectured materials including those with lattice and inverse opal topologies, and entropy stabilized refractory metal alloys and rare earth silicates. This work has addressed many fundamental questions associated with the atomic assembly of nanoscopic materials from the vapor phase, the topological structuring of cellular materials, and the processing of high temperature coatings and composites. His research has contributed to the improved design of thermal and environmental barrier coatings for gas turbine engine applications, liquid metal heat plates for hypersonic vehicle leading edges, passive jet blast deflector concepts, and numerous materials and structures for the mitigation of high intensity dynamic (ballistic impact and blast shock) loads.
