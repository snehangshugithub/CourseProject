Mechanical Engineering, State University of New York at Buffalo B.S. Mechanical Engineering, Helwan University, Helwan, Egypt About Ismail Dr. Orabi joined the faculty of the Mechanical Engineering Department in 1986. Professor Orabi received his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Cairo Institute of Technology (now Helwan University), in 1975, his M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the State University of New York at Buffalo, in 1982, and his Ph.D. degree from Clarkson University, in 1987. Prior to joining the University of New Haven, he taught at Clarkson University as an Instructor for two years in the department of mechanical engineering and two years at the Cairo Institute of Technology. Professor Orabi has received a number of research awards from the State of Connecticut and Untied Technologies and NSF. In 2010 he was awarded an NSF grant proposal (in collaboration with eight colleges) to Improved Learning for Undergraduate Engineering Programs ($600k). He has established two Laboratories: the Materials Testing laboratory sponsored by the National Science Foundation, and the Engineering Multimedia Laboratory funded by AT&T. Professor Orabi was awarded the ASEE Instrumentation Division Best Paper Award in 2000. Dr. Orabi was a VisitingProfessor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) (1996-1998). He is a member of ASME andASEE. Research Activities Dr. Orabi conducts theoretical and computational research in mechanical vibrations and dynamic systems and control. His more than 25 papers span a wide spectrum of problems in the dynamics of systems and structures. Dr. Orabi has also been involved in developing schemes for vibration control of space structures during the lift off and in orbit. Teaching Activities Professor Orabi has taught courses in both undergraduate and graduate level Mechanical Vibrations and Multimedia Engineering Analysis, and undergraduate level thermodynamics, Measurement Systems, Engineering Mechanics and Introduction to Engineering. One of Professor Orabi's most recent projects involves the development of learning modules. These modules provide undergraduate engineering students with improved learning of basic, conceptually-difficult engineering concepts in the context of a basic knowledge of finite element analysis.
