His Chemical Process Optimization, Multiscale Modelling and Process Systems research group develops and implements theoretical and computational tools that analyze, describe and predict the behaviour of complex chemical materials, processes and systems to support optimal design, performance and operations management. The group has specific expertise in advanced CO2 capture technologies and energy systems as well as computer-aided designs for heterogeneous catalysis. They use the multiscale modelling approach, which accounts for all phenomena, to gain a comprehensive perspective of processes. The group focusses on phenomena that evolve at multiple temporal and spatial scales, with particular focus on phenomena that take place at the fine (nano) scale. Their computerized tools, which utilize advanced mathematics, machine learning algorithms and uncertainty analyses, can simulate how chemical systems are likely to behave in real life. These simulations can be analyzed and used to maximize economic investment and process efficiency, often before any resources are used. They provide a fast, efficient and safe way to, for example, effectively and efficiently design new chemical materials and improve chemical process operations. Much of their work involves collaboration with government and industry to reduce carbon and greenhouse gas emissions and enhance emerging energy options. Current research includes the development of: New methodologies for optimal process design and operations management of dynamic systems under uncertainty Computer-aided design of materials and systems that evolve at different spatial and time scales Modelling, advanced model-based control and optimization of conventional and emerging energy systems, CO2 capture and conversion technologies, and novel process intensification systems for clean power production Multiscale models for manufacturing processes, such as thin film deposition, methane cracking reactions for the production of hydrogen and carbon nano-materials, and novel CO2 conversion technologies Novel and efficient mathematical formulations for optimal planning and scheduling of industrial-scale facilities to improve operations management in the manufacturing and analytical service sectors. Professor Ricardez-Sandovals research has been supported by the Government of Canada through its collaborative agencies (Canada Foundation for Innovation, Ontario Research Fund, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Mitacs, and CanmetENERGY); industrial partners (Activation Laboratories and Angstrom Engineering); and the Government of Ontario, through the Early Researchers Award granted by the Ministry of Research and Innovation. In addition, Ricardez-Sandoval has received graduate students and visiting scholars that have been financially supported by international agencies and institutions, such as Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT-Mexico), China Scholarship Council (CSC-China), Tampere University (Finland), and Universidad de Los Andes (Colombia). Professor Ricardez-Sandoval is also an Associate Editor of the Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering.Research InterestsProcess Systems EngineeringMultiscale ModellingComputer-aided Catalyst and Materials DesignChemical Process OptimizationOptimal Integration of Process Design, Control and SchedulingProcess IntensificationModelling and Simulation of Conventional and Emerging Energy and CO2 Capture TechnologiesModelling and Simulation of Micro and Nanotechnology SystemsOptimal Process SchedulingEducation2008, Doctorate, Chemical Engineering, University of Waterloo2000, Master of Science, Chemical Engineering, Instituto Tecnologico de Celaya1997, Bachelor of Science, Chemical Engineering, Instituto Tecnologico de OrizabaCourses*CHE 420 - Intro to Process ControlTaught in 2017, 2018, 2019CHE 500 - Spec.
