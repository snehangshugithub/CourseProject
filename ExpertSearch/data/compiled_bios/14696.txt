For example, our group has recently developed three simple dynamic chemistry approaches that allow for spent thermosets or crosslinked polymers to be recycled by melt-state processing into new crosslinked polymer products with full recovery of crosslink density and associated properties. In one case, we employ exactly the polymers and fillers used in the tire industry but substitute sulfur-based crosslinking with a dynamic alkoxyamine-based crosslinking method; the latter method yields robust crosslinks at elevated-temperature-use conditions but decrosslink at yet higher temperatures like those used in tire molding operations, thus allowing melt-state reprocessing. Two other methods have been developed for polyhydroxyurethane and polythiourethane crosslinked polymers, with these systems also showing promise for monomer recovery from spent polymers.We are also developing a deeper understanding of how nanoscale confinement of polymers in thin films or in nanocomposites can lead to major changes in properties, including glass transition temperature (which can change by 50 degrees C or more), physical aging, stiffness or modulus, and diffusion, among others. In support of our research efforts, we have developed simple non-destructive characterization tools that allow us to characterize the gradient in behavior from a free surface or substrate/nanofiller. We also doing fundamental research to understand how polymer architecture (e.g., cyclic or ring polymers, stars, hyperbranched polymers, brushes, bottlebrushes, etc.) and copolymer structure can modify the bulk and nanoconfined behaviors of polymers. In turn, we are using that understanding to engineer materials for improved performance. Finally, we also pursuing novel, industrially scalable solid-state processing approaches to design and produce modified polymers, polymer blends, composites, and nanocomposites that cannot be produced by conventional melt-state processing. Our process is the solid-state analog of twin-screw extrusion and allows for much greater work to be done on the polymeric materials during processing. As a result, our solid-state process achieves dispersion levels as well as chemistries that are not attainable with melt-state processing methods.Significant RecognitionMcCormick School of Engineering, Teacher of the Year, 2008Associated Student Government Faculty Honor Roll, 2007Polymer Physics Prize (awarded by the Journal of Polymer Science Part B: Polymer Physics), 2004Best Paper Award, Polymer Analysis Division, Society of Plastics Engineers, 2004 Charles M.A. Stine Award from the Materials Engineering and Science Division of the American Institute of Chemical Engineering, 2004Fellow, American Physical Society, 1999Associated Student Government Faculty Honor Roll, 1995-96McCormick School Advisor of the Year, 1993-94 NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award, 1987-92Ralph A.
