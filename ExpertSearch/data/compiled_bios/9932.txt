Group Studies Seminars, or Group Research, We 4:00PM - 5:29PM, Soda 306 Biography David Wagner earned an A. B. in Mathematics from Princeton, and M.S./Ph.D. degrees from UC Berkeley where he was advised by Eric Brewer. His research interests include computer security, systems security, usable security, and program analysis for security. He has previously worked on security for wearable devices, smartphone security, software security, electronic voting, wireless security, sensor network security, and applied cryptography. He has published two books and over 90 peer-reviewed scientific papers.Wagner is part of Berkeley's security research group. He was a PI for the Intel Science and Technology Center for Secure Computing and an active member of the TRUST and ACCURATE centers, is part of the Science of Security project. His software includes: OpenCount, a tool to help with auditing of elections conducted using optical-scan paper ballots; Joe-E, a Java-based programming language for secure programming; html-sanitizer-testbed, a suite of tests to probe the security of a HTML sanitizer; and CQual++, a tool for type inference analysis of C and C++ code. Wagner is a member of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC)'s Technical Guidelines Development Committee, tasked with assisting the EAC in drafting the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines. He was on the program committees of NDSS (2015, 2016), the WWW Security and Privacy track (2016), Usenix Security (2015), MObile Security Technologies (2015), and the Symposium On Usable Privacy and Security (2015). Wagner also served on the committee for the NSA Award for the Best Scientific Cybersecurity Paper, and on the editorial boards for CACM Research Highlights, and the Journal of Election Technology and Systems (JETS). He is a committed and active member of the open-access publication community.
