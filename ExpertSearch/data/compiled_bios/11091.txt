The characterization of quantum information and quantum entanglement has provided novel understanding to space-time geometry, and relate the dynamics of chaotic many-body systems to the dynamics of space-time, i.e. quantum gravity theory. Based on recent progress in holographic duality (also known as AdS/CFT), my goal is to use tools such as tensor networks and solvable models to provide more microscopic understanding to the emergent space-time geometry from quantum states and quantum dynamics. I am also interested in topological states and topological phenomena in condensed matter systems.You can find my recent research topics in some talks online: http://online.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/chord18/opgrowth/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__9VBaLfC6Y&t=42shttp://online.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/qinfo_c17/qi/ Academic Appointments Professor, Physics Administrative Appointments Professor, Stanford Univesity (2019 - Present) Associate Professor, Physics, Stanford University (2014 - 2018) Assistant Professor, Physics, Stanford University (2009 - 2014) Postdoctoral Researcher, Microsoft Station Q, UC Santa Barbara (2009 - 2010) Research Associate, Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (2007 - 2009) Honors & Awards Simons Investigator, Simons Foundation (2018) The New Horizons in Physics Prize, The Breakthrough Prize Foundation (2015) Sackler International Prize, Physics, Raymond and Beverly Sackler, Tel Aviv University (2014) Hermann Kummel Early Achievement Award, in Many-Body Physics, International Conference Advisory Committee (2011) Packard Fellowship, David and Lucile Packard Foundation (2011) Sloan Fellowship, Sloan Foundation (2010) Professional Education Ph.D., Institute for Advanced Study, Tsinghua University, Physics (2007) B.S., Tsinghua University, Physics (2003) Contact Academic xlqi@stanford.edu University - Faculty Department:&nbspPhysics Position:Professor Administrative Contact Donald J.
