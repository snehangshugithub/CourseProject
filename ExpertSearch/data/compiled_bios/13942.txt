Laub Professor of Biology; Co-Chair, Biology Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Faculty Committee; Member, DEI Council; Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Michael T. Laub explores how bacterial cells process information and regulate their own growth and proliferation, as well as how these information-processing capabilities have evolved. 617-324-0418 Phone 68-580 Office laub@mit.edu Email Lab Website Tau Zaman Assistant 617-452-2717 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 2002, Stanford University BS, 1997, Molecular Biology, University of California, San Diego Research Summary We study the biological mechanisms and evolution of how cells process information to regulate their own growth and proliferation. Using bacteria as a model organism, we aim to elucidate the detailed molecular basis for this remarkable regulatory capability, and understand the selective pressures and mechanisms that drive the evolution of signaling pathways. Our work is rooted in a desire to develop a deeper, fundamental understanding of how cells function and evolve, but it also has important medical implications since many signaling pathways in pathogenic bacteria are needed for virulence.
