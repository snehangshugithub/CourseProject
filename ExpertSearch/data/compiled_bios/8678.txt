Gu joined the Cornell faculty in 2018. Gu received her B.S. in Environmental Engineering and Science from Tsinghua University in Beijing, China and a Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering, jointly in Microbiology, from the University of Washington, US. She worked as a process engineer and research scientist for HDR Engineering, specializing in water and wastewater treatment processes design for three years before she returned to academia. Gu's major research interest involves understanding and applying biological agents (e.g. microorganisms) and their functions to detect, transform or mitigate environmental pollutants in both natural and engineered systems. Gu was a faculty member in the Department of Environmental Sciences at the Northeastern University from 2006 to 2017. She stays active in both academic societies and water professional organizations and has served on various committees for IWA, WEF, ACS and AEESP.Research InterestsGu's general research is in water quality and environmental health. She specifically focuses on the following areas: (1) apply biotechnology to improve and develop more sustainable wastewater treatment and remediation processes to maximize nutrient recovery and, minimize the energy consumption and carbon footprint; (i) investigate the impact of climate change on global phosphorus cycling, particularly biological processes, and associated implications in phosphorus utilization efficiency in agriculture; (iii) develop next-generation toxicogenomics-based toxicity assessment technology platform, in combination with data science, to enable risk-based water quality monitoring and technology efficacy assessment, and to elucidate the causal environmental matrices.Water SystemsBiotechnologyMolecular BiotechnologyHealth SystemsEnvironmental ProcessesTeaching InterestsApril Gu believes that teaching is a creative act based on passion and dedication; as it requires a variety of skills, strategies and visions. Besides the transferring of knowledge of fundamental concepts and theories, key goals of effective teaching are to generate motivation among the students to learn and develop independent thinking and analytical reasoning. She values the rigorousness in fundamental science and engineering teaching and therefore emphasizing on structured, yet integrative and complex problem-solving orientated curriculum design.Her experiences in industry have cultivated her the recognition and appreciation of the importance of knowledge translation. April has taught Environmental Biological Processes, Water and Wastewater Treatment Processes, Water Engineering, Resources and Energy Recovery and Fluid Mechanics at Northeastern University. At Cornell, Gu will likely be teaching: Microbiology for Environmental Engineering, Biological Processes, Special Topics in Environmental Engineering.Selected PublicationsLi, Dan; zeng, siyu; He, Miao; Gu, April Z.
