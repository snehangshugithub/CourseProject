His primary research is conducted at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, near Geneva, Switzerland, where protons collide at the highest energy presently achievable in the lab. Mulhearn seeks evidence for new particles created in these collisions, such as the recently discovered Higgs boson and long hypothesized, but so far undiscovered, magnetic monopoles. As an integral part of his research, Mulhearn contributes to the instrumentation needed to collect data for high-energy experiments, particularly the high-speed custom trigger electronics responsible for selecting the most interesting events for further scrutiny. He is also studying the effect of radiation on configurable electronics, which will be needed for future experiments that will push our present technology to new limits.
