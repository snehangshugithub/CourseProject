He joined the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Hawaii in 1987. Dr. Malhotra is the co-editor of two books, co-author of a book-chapter and over twenty journal publications. He is a member of the American Vacuum Society (AVS), Electrochemical Society (ECS), and Eta Kappa Nu. He also has three invited papers,a best poster award, and a patent to his credit. He has served as a symposium chairman and technical session chairman for State-of-the-art Program On Compound Semiconductor symposia of ECS. He is also a recipient of the Regents Medal for Excellence in Teaching, 1991 (highest honor in teaching at the University of Hawaii). His current research interest includes wet and dry processes for passivation of GaAs and InP surfaces and surface-sensitive devices, such as HBTs, MSM photodetectors and VCSELs. He is also developing novel low-damage 'soft' plasma processes for SiNx deposition using electron cyclotron resonance plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique. His previous work includes novel optical sensors, fabrication and characterization of refractory metal silicides, and fundamentals of memory switching in silicon thin films for fuse-programmable memories.
