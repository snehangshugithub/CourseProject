Dr. Baliga and his laboratory are using a multidisciplinary systems approach to understand this process. Once delineated the engineering principles governing assembly of biological systems will help unlock potentials within diverse organisms. By responsibly using this information we will be able to power spectacular solutions for problems in environment and medicine.Dr. Baliga is an Affiliate Professor in the Department of Biology at UW and a Professor at the Institute for Systems Biology, where he also serves as Senior Vice President and Director. He did his early schooling in Mumbai, India, where he received a B.Sc. in Microbiology (1992) from Ruia College. He also has a M.Sc. in Marine Biotechnology (1994) from Goa University, and a Ph.D. in Microbiology from University of Massachusetts at Amherst (2000). Dr. Baliga's graduate work was supported by two highly coveted awards from the Central Government of India including the Department of Biotechnology studentship, as well as the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research fellowship. Dr. Baliga's work has been featured in The Scientist, Genome Web, Wired magazine, Genetic Engineering News, Ars Technica, Xconomy, and Nature Methods, among many others. His research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, NASA, Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense. He is the Section Editor of BMC Systems Biology, serves on scientific advisory boards of numerous academic and industrial organizations, and has been instrumental in research program planning for the NSF, US Army, ARPA-E and DOE. Dr. Baliga is also actively engaged in bringing innovative inquiry-based curriculum on current science concepts to high schools throughout the United States. In 2012 he was the recipient of the Alvin J. Thompson award in recognition of his contributions to HS education.His primary goal is to develop mind stimulating lessons that will prepare a new generation of scientists.
