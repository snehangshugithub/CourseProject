My research often involves adding linguistic structure (e.g., syntax, semantics, coreference) to statistical models of text. As such, I'm especially interested in developing core NLP techniques for a variety of languages and domains (e.g., literary text, social media). Before Berkeley, I received my PhD at Carnegie Mellon (School of Computer Science, Language Technologies Institute) and was a senior researcher at the Perseus Project of Tufts University.
