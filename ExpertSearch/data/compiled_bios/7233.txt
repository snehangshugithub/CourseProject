My research group works on nonlinear fracture mechanics, size effects and scaling of failure, stability of structures, micromechanics of damage in materials, inelastic constitutive laws, creep and hygrothermal effects in nanoporous materials, chemo-mechanics, failure of fiber composites, hydraulic fracturing of shale, geothermal energy, impact problems, probabilistic mechanics of quasibrittle structures, plasticity and finite strain, with related numerical methods. Our research, which emphasizes mathematical modeling based on experiments, has been focused on concrete, rock, sea ice, braided and woven composites for automobile crashworthiness, hybrid joints for ships, rigid foams, shape memory alloys, dry snow slabs, fracking of gas shale, probabilistic analysis of quasibrittle failure, especially the tail distribution of strength, probability of static and fatigue lifetime, failure probability of biomimetic (architectured, nacreous) materials, predictions of creep and shrinkage effects in concrete structures, formulation of standards for concrete and ceramics, and applications to gas shale, fiber-polymer composites for aircraft and ships, metallic thin films, reinforced concrete structures and granular materials.
