Projects ASCI Flash Research My current interests focus on bioinformatics, via the Digital Biology Project, and the automatic generation of software to support scientific simulation, via the FEniCS project. The Digital Biology Project seeks to understand how protein systems function in a discrete fashion, especially in the presence of hydrophobic effects (which are very non-specific). FEniCS is a polymorhpic acronym for an international effort (www.fenics.org) that attempts to utilize mathematical structure inherent in scientific models to automate the generation of simulation software.
