Currently she leads a weed managment project for mechanised and broadcast lowland crop production systems in Laos and Cambodia. While a recently completed project focused on mechanization and value adding for diversification of lowland cropping systems. Jaquie is also lead investigator of an AgriFutures funded rice project examining genetic variation in physiological traits of importance to aerobic adaptation, and potential donor genotypes for use by the Australian rice breeding program aimed at aerobic production for the Riverina and northern Australia. Previous research activities include examining genetic variation for resistance to abiotic stress, such as low-temperature tolerance at the reproductive stage in rice, the advantage of reduced-tillering gene in wheat grown under terminal drought, the effect of salinity and water-deficit on production of volatile compounds in aromatic rice. Based at The University of Queensland, School of Agriculture and Food Sciences, Jaquie provides specialist guidance and assistance to undergraduate and postgraduate research students within crop physiology and agronomy. She has extensive experience conducting research projects focused on abiotic stress and cropping systems research.
