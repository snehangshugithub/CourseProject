Prizes from professional societies, foundations, and government organizations provide one form of recognition. Election to elite scientific societies serves as another type of recognition. Several members of the faculty have also been active in the governance of scientific organizations or have served on committees that guide national science policy.A partial list of our scientific awards can be found in the Scientific Recognition table below. Our faculty is dedicated to teaching as well as to research. A partial list of awards in recognition of excellence in the classroom can be found in the Academic Distinction table below.
