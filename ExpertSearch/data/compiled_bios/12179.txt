I am a co-founder of Urban@UW, and with support from the MacArthur Foundation and Microsoft, I lead UW's participation in the MetroLab Network. I created a first MOOC on Data Science through Coursera, and I led the creation of the UW Data Science Masters Degree, where I serve as its first Program Director and Faculty Chair. I serve on the Steering Committee of the Center for Statistics in the Social Sciences. My group's research aims to make the techniques and technologies of data science dramatically more accessible, particularly at scale. Our methods are rooted in database models and languages, though we sometimes work in machine learning, visualization, HCI, and high-performance computing. We are an applied, systems-oriented group, frequently sourcing projects through collaborations in the physical, life, and social sciences.
