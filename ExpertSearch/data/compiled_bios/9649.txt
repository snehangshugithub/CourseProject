His research at Cornell focuses on the development of precision medicine technologies for the monitoring of infectious diseases and immune related complications. De Vlaminck received postdoctoral training in the labs of Stephen Quake at Stanford University and Cees Dekker at the TUDelft. He obtained a PhD in Science and Engineering from the KULeuven in Belgium. He was awarded the NIH Directors New Innovator Award and the Robert 55 and Vanne 57 Cowie Excellence in Teaching Award in 2017 and the Robert Noyce Assistant Professorship in 2015.Prof. De Vlamincks research focuses on the development of molecular analysis technologies for microbiology and immunology and the application of these technologies in the monitoring of infectious diseases and immune-related complications. His research is highly interdisciplinary in nature, and requires innovation in genomics, computational biology and molecular engineering.For regularly updated information, visit the De Vlaminck Lab website pages:overview of researchcurrent and former group membersrecent publicationsVisit our lab website for more information about our current research projects.Research InterestsDrug Delivery and NanomedicineBiomedical Imaging and InstrumentationBioengineeringBiomedical EngineeringMolecular and Cellular EngineeringComputational Science and EngineeringSystems and Synthetic BiologySelected PublicationsFor a full list of publications, visit our research website.Alexandre Pellan Cheng, Matthew Pellan Cheng, Wei Gu, Joan Sesing Lenz, Elaine Hsu, Erwin Schurr, Guillaume Bourque, Mathieu Bourgey, Jerome Ritz, Francisco Marty, Charles Y.
