I can only make them think." - Socrates I see myself as a coach and a mentor focused on inspiring students to learn, pursue excellence, and capitalize on their innate strengths. Four tenets of my teaching philosophy are: Help students understand the value proposition of learning the subject matter covered in a course Help students develop skills to devise innovative solutions to complex problems with consideration of global and societal contexts Make sure that students have a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles and that they develop competencies to apply the principles to solve seemingly intractable problems Ensure that students learn to exercise highest levels of professional ethics and personal integrity in every aspect of engineering problem solving and interpersonal interactions The courses I have taught are: AOE 4065: Air Vehicle Design (1st of two-course sequence taught in fall semester) AOE 4066: Air Vehicle Design (2nd of two-course sequence taught in spring semester) AOE 4114: Applied Computational Fluid Dynamics (co-instructor with Prof. Coutier-Delgosha) AOE 4984-5984: Design of Projects (co-instructor with Prof. Grossmann of VT and Prof. Moser of MIT) Research expertise Applied Computational Aerodynamics for Air Vehicle Design Service to the profession and society Chair, AOE Honorifics Committee, 2012present Member, COE Honorifics Committee, 2012present Member, VT AOE Undergraduate Curriculum Committee, 2015present Chair, VT AOE Ad hoc Strategic Planning Committee, 20162018 Member, External Review Team, Comprehensive Digital Transformation (CDT) program, NASA-Langley Research Center, 2016-present Member, Advisory Committee for the Engineered Surfaces, Materials, and Coatings (ESMC) for Aircraft Drag Reduction program, Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), 2015present Member, AIAA Aircraft Design Technical Committee (ADTC), 2013present Member, Strategic Advisory Committee, AFRL/ VT/ WSU CCMS (Collaborative Center for Multidisciplinary Sciences), 20082011 Member, Industrial Advisory Board, Michigan/AFRL/Boeing CCAS (Collaborative Center for Aeronautical Sciences), 20072011 Member, SAE Teetor Educational Award Committee, 20062011 Member, Council on Competitiveness National Advisory Committee, High Performance Computing Initiative, 20032011 Technical Program Co-Chair, 9th AIAA/ISSMO Symposium on Multidisciplinary Analysis and Optimization Conference, Atlanta, GA, 4-6 September, 2002 Member, Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) TC, 19931997 Member, NRC ASEB Fluids Panel to evaluate AFOSR proposals, 19962002 Member, Applied Aerodynamics TC, 19891992 Member, Fluid Dynamics TC, 19851988 Invited Peer Review Panel Member for (a) Sandia National Lab, Compressible Fluid Mechanics and Aerothermodynamics, 1999;
