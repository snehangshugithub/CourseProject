Kirschstein National Research Service Award (F32, MSKCC), 2014 2017 Graduate Dissertation Year Fellowship (UCLA), 2012 2013 Senior Christopher S. Foote Fellowship in Organic Chemistry (UCLA), 2011 2013 RESEARCH INTERESTS The Roberts laboratory will be open August 2017 Research in the Roberts laboratory is focused on the design and chemical synthesis of peptide-based therapeutics. Our chemistry draws inspiration from the unique structural elements and function present in ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and miniproteins. We are interested in the development of chemoselective methods for peptide ligation, macrocyclization, glycosylation and modification. Additionally, we are interested in discovering catalysis methods for the cleavage and functionalization of carbon-nitrogen (CN) bonds in small molecule and natural product synthesis efforts.
