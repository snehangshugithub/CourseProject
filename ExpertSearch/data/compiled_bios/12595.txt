Her research interests involve understanding how people perceive and interact with environmental systems. She has established a strong track record in applying cognitive constructs, including mental models and values, to explore how people make sense of and relate to their environment, particularly in relation to water resources. Two of her publications are placed in the top 1% of the academic field of Social Sciences (Clarivate, 2020). Natalie has an interest in designing and implementing participatory processes to support decision-making, and is building a research program around the social dimensions of regenerative agriculture. Natalie has conducted applied social science research within a number of interdisciplinary teams involving governments, research organisations, non-governmental organisations and Indigenous groups. She has published more than 25 academic papers and book chapters. Natalie is a Lecturer of Rural Development within the School of Agriculture and Food Sciences. Prior to taking up her position at UQ, Natalie was a Researcher at the Australian National University working in the Resource Management of the Asia Pacific Program. This involved working as a social scientist in an international collaboration with CIRAD Agricultural Research for Development, to evaluate 34 participatory modelling projects globally. She has undertaken consultancies with various natural resource management groups within Australia, including Healthy Land and Water and Seqwater.
