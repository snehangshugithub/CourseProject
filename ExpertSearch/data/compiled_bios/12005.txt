Quantitative measurements of precipitation depend on modelling of scattering by hydrometors. Key words: Hydrometeors, Scattering Open to supervise Radar Imagery Polarimetric Radars, such as synthetic aperture (SAR) record multiparameter data at sufficiently high resolution to form images. An ongoing research problem is how to reduce the complexity of the data in a meaningful way as one or more images. Key words: Polarimetric Imagery Open to supervise Electromagnetic Wave Propagation in Remote Sensing and Fibre Optics Propagation of Coherent Electromagnetic waves in inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic media induces attenuation and changes of polarization state which affect many kinds of remote sensing systems. Key words: Coherent propagation, Polarization Open to supervise Polarization Algebra Radar polarimetry has posed challenges for a sufficiently general and physically consistent algebraic framework over several decades. Target vector formalism was formulated around an SU3/U3 group symmetry although this is reconcilable with Electromagnetic Theory. Projective geometric methods provide an alternative approach which is physically consistent. Key words: Electromagnetic Polairization Open to supervise Teaching and supervision Current teaching responsibilities Foundations of Electronics I (CE163) Team Project Challenge (CE201) Previous supervision Jawad Alaa A Shaker Thesis title: Modelling of Electromagnetic Scattering At Infrared Wavelengths By Pristine Ice Crystals Degree subject: Electronic Systems Engineering Degree type: Doctor of Philosophy Awarded date: 18/9/2019 Ayibapreye Kelvin Benjamin Thesis title: Evaluation of Millimetre-Wave Coherent Scattering From a Sea Surface Covered By Foam Modelled as Sequences of Thin Phase-Scattering Screens Using Split-Step Fourier Method Degree subject: Computing and Electronic Systems Degree type: Doctor of Philosophy Awarded date: 24/7/2019 Felix Opuama Ngobigha Thesis title: Development of a Discrete Numerical Approach to the Fredholm Integral Method for Evaluating Microwave Scattering By Irregular Hydrometeors Degree subject: Computing and Electronic Systems Degree type: Doctor of Philosophy Awarded date: 27/1/2016 Seyyedkamal Hashemi Thesis title: Microwave Devices and Techniques for Ultra-Wideband (Uwb) Communication Systems Degree subject: Computing and Electronic Systems Degree type: Doctor of Philosophy Awarded date: 15/12/2011 Publications Journal articles (28) Bebbington, D. and Carrea, L., (2017).
