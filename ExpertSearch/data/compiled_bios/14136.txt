Ober Francis Norwood Bard Professor of Metallurgical Engineering Materials Science and Engineering Bard Hall, Room 310 607/255-8417 Director cko3@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyChristopher Kemper Ober is the Francis Bard Professor of Materials Engineering at Cornell University. After several years in industry at the Xerox Research Centre of Canada, Ober arrived at Cornell in 1986. His research is focused on lithography, patterning, the biology materials interface and control of surface structure in thin films. As a reflection of his contributions to lithography, Ober in 2015 was honored with the Photopolymer Science & Technology Outstanding Contribution Award. He is the 2006 winner of the American Chemical Society Award in Applied Polymer Science, and received a Humboldt Research Prize in 2007. In 2009, Ober was named a Fellow of the American Chemical Society and was awarded the Gutenberg Research Prize by the University of Mainz. Ober served as Interim Dean of Engineering 2009 - 2010. In 2014 he was a JSPS Fellow in Japan. More recently he was elected a fellow of APS (2014) and AAAS (2015) and made a SPIE Senior Member (2018). He is currently the Director of the Cornell Nanoscale Facility.Research InterestsThe ability to tailor the chemical structure of materials provides the ability to exquisitely control materials properties. Polymers, more than any other material, offer this possibility to fine-tune their thermal, optical and electrical properties through precise changes to molecular structure. Polymers are also the basis of the nanotechnology revolution, serving as photoresists used to create nanometer scale structures. Our research is therefore focused in three areas: (i) fundamental studies of self-organization in polymers, (ii) lithographic materials for microelectronics and biotechnology and (iii) new environmentally and biologically friendly materials. Each of these topics involves creative polymer synthesis using state-of-the-art facilities and methods as well as advanced characterization tools, most of which are located here at Cornell University. The research group, consisting of a mixture of graduate students and post-doctoral associates, takes part in highly collaborative research with leading groups at Cornell and around the world.Research ProjectsEnvironmentally friendly, fouling resistant surfaces (ONR)Polymer brushes and interface engineering (NSF)Controlled sequence EUV resists (CINEMA Team/Intel)Polyelectrolyte brushes in nanoconfinement (NSF)Protective barrier coatings for fabrics (DTRA)Scissionable polymers (Intel/SRC)Polymers and Soft MatterAdvanced MaterialsBiomedical EngineeringColloids and Interfacial ScienceMaterials Synthesis and ProcessingNanobio ApplicationsNanotechnologyResearch Group MembersSelected PublicationsMichael Tsuei, Hai Tran, Sangchul Roh, Christopher K Ober, Nicolas Abbott, Using Liquid Crystals to Probe the Organization of Helical Polypeptide Brushes Induced by Solvent Pretreatment, Macromolecules, 2021, In Press.Amanda Leonardi, Aria C Zhang, Nilay Dzen, Nick Aldred, John A Finlay, Jessica L Clarke, Anthony S Clare, Rachel A Segalman, Christopher K Ober, Amphiphilic Nitroxide-Bearing Siloxane-Based Block Copolymer Coatings for Enhanced Marine Fouling Release, ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, 2021, 13(24), 28790-28801Yuming Huang, Hai Tran, Christopher K Ober, High-Resolution Nanopatterning of Free-Standing, Self-Supported Helical Polypeptide Rod Brushes via Electron Beam Lithography, ACS Macro Letters, 2021, 10(6), 755-759Mayank Misra, Ziwei Liu, Ban Xuan Dong, Shrayesh N Patel, Paul F Nealey, Christopher K Ober, Fernando A Escobedo, Thermal Stability of -Conjugated n-Ethylene-Glycol-Terminated Quaterthiophene Oligomers: A Computational and Experimental Study, ACS Macro Letters, 2020, 9(3), 295-300DungYi Wu, Florian Kfer, Nicholas Diaco, Christopher K Ober, SilicaPMMA hairy nanoparticles prepared via phase transferassisted aqueous miniemulsion atom transfer radical polymerization, 2020, 58(17), 2310-2316Christopher K.
