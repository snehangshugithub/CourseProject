Our group created the first Bose and Fermi degenerate gases of the most magnetic atom, dysprosium. Recently, we have used 1D gases of Dy to create a dipolar quantum Newton's cradle, which we used to explore novel aspects of quantum thermalization.Many-Body Cavity QED: Investigations of many-body physics in an AMO context often employ a static optical lattice to create a periodic potential. Such systems, while capable of exploring, e.g., the Hubbard model, lack the fully emergent crystalline order found in solid state systems whose stiffness is not imposed externally, but arises dynamically. Our multimode cavity QED experiment introduces fully emergent and compliant optical lattices to the ultracold atom toolbox and provides new avenues to explore beyond mean-field physics and quantum soft matter. Quantum liquid crystals, superglasses, and spin glasses may be explored. Quantum neural networks can be engineered in these driven, dissipative spin systems may prove to be powerful for computing solutions to NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems.The SQCRAMscope: We have created the SQCRAMscope, a novel Scanning Quantum CRyogenic Atom Microscope technique for imaging magnetic and electric fields arising from cryogenically cooled materials. With our SQCRAMscope, we aim to image inhomogeneous transport and domain percolation in technologically relevant materials whose order has evaded elucidation. Our current projects include imaging transport in unconventional superconductors and topologically non-trivial materials. 2021-22 Courses Literature of Quantum SimulationAPPPHYS 376 (Spr) Quantum GasesAPPPHYS 282, PHYSICS 182, PHYSICS 282 (Win) Independent Studies (5) Directed Studies in Applied PhysicsAPPPHYS 290 (Aut, Win, Spr, Sum) Independent Research and StudyPHYSICS 190 (Aut, Win, Spr) Practical TrainingAPPPHYS 291 (Sum) ResearchPHYSICS 490 (Aut, Win, Spr, Sum) Senior Thesis ResearchPHYSICS 205 (Aut, Win) Prior Year Courses 2019-20 Courses Atoms, Fields and PhotonsAPPPHYS 203 (Aut) Quantum GasesAPPPHYS 282, PHYSICS 182, PHYSICS 282 (Win) 2018-19 Courses Atoms, Fields and PhotonsAPPPHYS 203 (Aut) Introduction to Modern Atomic Physics and Quantum OpticsAPPPHYS 282, PHYSICS 182, PHYSICS 282 (Win) Stanford Advisees Doctoral Dissertation Reader (AC) Omer Hazon, Vasily Kruzhilin Doctoral Dissertation Advisor (AC) Brandon Freudenstein, Ronen Kroeze, Kuan-Yu Li, Kuan-Yu Lin Doctoral (Program) Tyler Anderson, Logan Bishop-Van Horn, Aaron Breidenbach, Morgan Brubaker, Sam Carman, Sanyum Channa, Yi-Shiou Duh, Ben Foutty, Brandon Freudenstein, Kuan-Yu Lin, John Peterson, Linsey Rodenbach, Ben Safvati, Zhen Su, Steven Tran, Atsushi Yamamura, Xinyang Zhang, Henry Zheng All Publications An optical lattice with sound. Nature Guo, Y., Kroeze, R. M., Marsh, B. P., Gopalakrishnan, S., Keeling, J., Lev, B. L. 2021; 599 (7884): 211-215 Abstract Quantized sound waves-phonons-govern the elastic response of crystalline materials, and also play an integral part in determining their thermodynamic properties and electrical response (for example, by binding electrons into superconducting Cooper pairs)1-3. The physics of lattice phonons and elasticity is absent in simulators of quantum solids constructed of neutral atoms in periodic light potentials: unlike real solids, traditional optical lattices are silent because they are infinitely stiff4. Optical-lattice realizations of crystals therefore lack some of the central dynamical degrees of freedom that determine the low-temperature properties of real materials. Here, we create an optical lattice with phonon modes using a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) coupled to a confocal optical resonator. Playing the role of an active quantum gas microscope, the multimode cavity QED system both images the phonons and induces the crystallization that supports phonons via short-range, photon-mediated atom-atom interactions. Dynamical susceptibility measurements reveal the phonon dispersion relation, showing that these collective excitations exhibit a sound speed dependent on the BEC-photon coupling strength. Our results pave the way for exploring the rich physics of elasticity in quantum solids, ranging from quantum melting transitions5 to exotic 'fractonic' topological defects6 in the quantum regime.

Science (New York, N.Y.) Kao, W. n., Li, K. Y., Lin, K. Y., Gopalakrishnan, S. n., Lev, B. L. 2021; 371 (6526): 296300 Abstract Long-lived excited states of interacting quantum systems that retain quantum correlations and evade thermalization are of great fundamental interest. We create nonthermal states in a bosonic one-dimensional (1D) quantum gas of dysprosium by stabilizing a super-Tonks-Girardeau gas against collapse and thermalization with repulsive long-range dipolar interactions. Stiffness and energy-per-particle measurements show that the system is dynamically stable regardless of contact interaction strength. This enables us to cycle contact interactions from weakly to strongly repulsive, then strongly attractive, and finally weakly attractive. We show that this cycle is an energy-space topological pump (caused by a quantum holonomy). Iterating this cycle offers an unexplored topological pumping method to create a hierarchy of increasingly excited prethermal states.

Physical review letters Rylands, C. n., Guo, Y. n., Lev, B. L., Keeling, J. n., Galitski, V. n. 2020; 125 (1): 010404 Abstract The Peierls instability toward a charge density wave is a canonical example of phonon-driven strongly correlated physics and is intimately related to topological quantum matter and exotic superconductivity. We propose a method for realizing an analogous photon-mediated Peierls transition, using a system of one-dimensional tubes of interacting Bose or Fermi atoms trapped inside a multimode confocal cavity. Pumping the cavity transversely engineers a cavity-mediated metal-to-insulator transition in the atomic system. For strongly interacting bosons in the Tonks-Girardeau limit, this transition can be understood (through fermionization) as being the Peierls instability. We extend the calculation to finite values of the interaction strength and derive analytic expressions for both the cavity field and mass gap. They display nontrivial power law dependence on the dimensionless matter-light coupling.

M., Vaidya, V. D., Keeling, J., Lev, B. L. 2019; 122 (19): 193601 Abstract Sign-changing interactions constitute a crucial ingredient in the creation of frustrated many-body systems such as spin glasses. We present here the demonstration of a photon-mediated sign-changing interaction between Bose-Einstein-condensed atoms in a confocal cavity. The interaction between two atoms is of an unusual, nonlocal form proportional to the cosine of the inner product of the atoms' position vectors. This interaction arises from the differing Gouy phase shifts of the cavity's degenerate modes. The interaction drives a nonequilibrium Dicke-type phase transition in the system leading to atomic checkerboard density-wave order. Because of the Gouy phase anomalies, the checkerboard pattern can assume either a sinelike or cosinelike character. This state is detected via the holographic imaging of the cavity's superradiant emission. Together with a companion paper [Y. Guo, V.D. Vaidya, R.M. Kroeze, R.A. Lunney, B.L. Lev, and J.

Employing this interaction in cavity QED spin systems may enable the creation of artificial spin glasses and quantum neural networks.

L. 2018; 120 (23): 230401 Abstract We demonstrate the tuning of the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) within a dysprosium Bose-Einstein condensate by rapidly rotating the orientation of the atomic dipoles. The tunability of the dipolar mean-field energy manifests as a modified gas aspect ratio after time-of-flight expansion. We demonstrate that both the magnitude and the sign of the DDI can be tuned using this technique. In particular, we show that a magic rotation angle exists at which the mean-field DDI can be eliminated, and at this angle, we observe that the expansion dynamics of the condensate is close to that predicted for a nondipolar gas. The ability to tune the strength of the DDI opens new avenues toward the creation of exotic soliton and vortex states as well as unusual quantum lattice phases and Weyl superfluids.

M., Guo, Y. n., Vaidya, V. D., Keeling, J. n., Lev, B. L. 2018; 121 (16): 163601 Abstract We observe the joint spin-spatial (spinor) self-organization of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) strongly coupled to an optical cavity. This unusual nonequilibrium Hepp-Lieb-Dicke phase transition is driven by an off-resonant Raman transition formed from a classical pump field and the emergent quantum dynamical cavity field. This mediates a spinor-spinor interaction that, above a critical strength, simultaneously organizes opposite spinor states of the BEC on opposite checkerboard configurations of an emergent 2D lattice. The resulting spinor density-wave polariton condensate is observed by directly detecting the atomic spin and momentum state and by holographically reconstructing the phase of the emitted cavity field. The latter provides a direct measure of the spin state, and a spin-spatial domain wall is observed. The photon-mediated spin interactions demonstrated here may be engineered to create dynamical gauge fields and quantum spin glasses.

Q., Lev, B. L. 2017; 25 (4): 3411-3419 Abstract We report the first measurement of a tune-out wavelength for ground-state bosonic Dy and linearly polarized light. The tune-out wavelength is measured as a detuning from the nearby narrow-line 741-nm transition in 162Dy, and is the wavelength at which the total Stark shift of the ground state vanishes. We find that it strongly depends on the relative angle between the optical field and quantization axis due to Dy's large tensor polarizability. This anisotropy provides a wide, 22-GHz tunability of the tune-out frequency for linearly polarized light, in contrast to Rb and Cs whose near-infrared tune-out wavelengths do not exhibit large anisotropy. The measurements of the total light shift are performed by measuring the contrast of multipulse Kapitza-Dirac diffraction. The calculated wavelengths are within a few GHz of the measured values using known Dy electronic transition data. The lack of hyperfine structure in bosonic Dy implies that the tune-out wavelengths for the other bosonic Dy isotopes should be related to this 162Dy measurement by the known isotope shifts.

Nature communications Kollr, A. J., Papageorge, A. T., Vaidya, V. D., Guo, Y., Keeling, J., Lev, B. L. 2017; 8: 14386-? Abstract Phase transitions, where observable properties of a many-body system change discontinuously, can occur in both open and closed systems. By placing cold atoms in optical cavities and inducing strong coupling between light and excitations of the atoms, one can experimentally study phase transitions of open quantum systems. Here we observe and study a non-equilibrium phase transition, the condensation of supermode-density-wave polaritons. These polaritons are formed from a superposition of cavity photon eigenmodes (a supermode), coupled to atomic density waves of a quantum gas. As the cavity supports multiple photon spatial modes and because the light-matter coupling can be comparable to the energy splitting of these modes, the composition of the supermode polariton is changed by the light-matter coupling on condensation. By demonstrating the ability to observe and understand density-wave-polariton condensation in the few-mode-degenerate cavity regime, our results show the potential to study similar questions in fully multimode cavities.

E., Lev, B. L., Keeling, J. 2017; 118 (4) Abstract Previous realizations of synthetic gauge fields for ultracold atoms do not allow the spatial profile of the field to evolve freely. We propose a scheme which overcomes this restriction by using the light in a multimode cavity with many nearly degenerate transverse modes, in conjunction with Raman coupling, to realize an artificial magnetic field which acts on a Bose-Einstein condensate of neutral atoms. We describe the evolution of such a system and present the results of numerical simulations which show dynamical coupling between the effective field and the matter on which it acts. Crucially, the freedom of the spatial profile of the field is sufficient to realize a close analogue of the Meissner effect, where the magnetic field is expelled from the superfluid. This backaction of the atoms on the synthetic field distinguishes the Meissner-like effect described here from the Hess-Fairbank suppression of rotation in a neutral superfluid observed elsewhere.

Our results extend the utility of expansion imaging by providing accurate thermometry for dipolar thermal Bose gases. Furthermore, we present a simple method to determine scattering lengths in dipolar gases, including near a Feshbach resonance, through observation of thermal gas expansion.

Q., Baumann, K., Tang, Y., Lu, M., Lev, B. L. 2015; 114 (2): 023201-? Abstract We observe the suppression of inelastic dipolar scattering in ultracold Fermi gases of the highly magnetic atom dysprosium: the more energy that is released, the less frequently these exothermic reactions take place, and only quantum spin statistics can explain this counterintuitive effect. Inelastic dipolar scattering in nonzero magnetic fields leads to heating or to loss of the trapped population, both detrimental to experiments intended to study quantum many-body physics with strongly dipolar gases. Fermi statistics, however, is predicted to lead to a kinematic suppression of these harmful reactions. Indeed, we observe a 120-fold suppression of dipolar relaxation in fermionic versus bosonic Dy, as expected from theory describing universal inelastic dipolar scattering, though never before experimentally confirmed. Similarly, low inelastic cross sections are observed in spin mixtures, also with striking correspondence to predictions. The suppression of relaxation opens the possibility of employing fermionic dipolar species in studies of quantum many-body physics involving, e.g., synthetic gauge fields and pairing.

Q., Lev, B. L. 2012; 108 (21) Abstract We report the first quantum degenerate dipolar Fermi gas, the realization of which opens a new frontier for exploring strongly correlated physics and, in particular, quantum liquid crystalline phases. A quantum degenerate Fermi gas of the most magnetic atom 161Dy is produced by laser cooling to 10 K before sympathetically cooling with ultracold, bosonic 162Dy. The temperature of the spin-polarized 161Dy is a factor T/T(F)=0.2 below the Fermi temperature T(F)=300 nK. The cotrapped 162Dy concomitantly cools to approximately T(c) for Bose-Einstein condensation, thus realizing a novel, nearly quantum degenerate dipolar Bose-Fermi gas mixture. Additionally, we achieve the forced evaporative cooling of spin-polarized 161Dy without 162Dy to T/T(F)=0.7. That such a low temperature ratio is achieved may be a first signature of universal dipolar scattering.

L., Goldbart, P. M. 2011; 107 (27) Abstract We show that the effective spin-spin interaction between three-level atoms confined in a multimode optical cavity is long-ranged and sign changing, like the RKKY interaction; therefore, ensembles of such atoms subject to frozen-in positional randomness can realize spin systems having disordered and frustrated interactions. We argue that, whenever the atoms couple to sufficiently many cavity modes, the cavity-mediated interactions give rise to a spin glass. In addition, we show that the quantum dynamics of cavity-confined spin systems is that of a Bose-Hubbard model with strongly disordered hopping but no on-site disorder; this model exhibits a random-singlet glass phase, absent in conventional optical-lattice realizations. We briefly discuss experimental signatures of the realizable phases.

Q., Youn, S. H., Lev, B. L. 2011; 107 (19) Abstract We report the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of the most magnetic element, dysprosium. The Dy BEC is the first for an open f-shell lanthanide (rare-earth) element and is produced via forced evaporation in a crossed optical dipole trap loaded by an unusual, blue-detuned and spin-polarized narrowline magneto-optical trap. Nearly pure condensates of 1.5 10(4) (164)Dy atoms form below T = 30 nK. We observe that stable BEC formation depends on the relative angle of a small polarizing magnetic field to the axis of the oblate trap, a property of trapped condensates only expected in the strongly dipolar regime. This regime was heretofore only attainable in Cr BECs via a Feshbach resonance accessed at a high-magnetic field.

L., Long, R., Esteve, J., Reichel, J. 2010; 104 (20) Abstract We prepare and detect the hyperfine state of a single 87Rb atom coupled to a fiber-based high-finesse cavity on an atom chip. The atom is extracted from a Bose-Einstein condensate and trapped at the maximum of the cavity field, resulting in a reproducibly strong atom-cavity coupling. We use the cavity reflection and transmission signal to infer the atomic hyperfine state with a fidelity exceeding 99.92% in a readout time of 100s. The atom is still trapped after detection.

H., Lev, B. L. 2010; 104 (6) Abstract Ultracold dysprosium gases, with a magnetic moment 10 times that of alkali atoms and equal only to terbium as the most magnetic atom, are expected to exhibit a multitude of fascinating collisional dynamics and quantum dipolar phases, including quantum liquid crystal physics. We report the first laser cooling and trapping of half a billion Dy atoms using a repumper-free magneto-optical trap (MOT) and continuously loaded magnetic confinement, and we characterize the trap recycling dynamics for bosonic and fermionic isotopes. The first inelastic collision measurements in the few partial wave, 100 microK-1 mK, regime are made in a system possessing a submerged open electronic f shell. In addition, we observe unusual stripes of intra-MOT <10 microK sub-Doppler cooled atoms.

J., Lev, B. L., Ye, J. 2008; 101 (26) Abstract A fundamental limit to the sensitivity of optical interferometry is thermal noise that drives fluctuations in the positions of the surfaces of the interferometer's mirrors, and thereby in the phase of the intracavity field. Schemes for reducing this thermally driven phase noise are presented that rely upon the coherent character of the underlying displacements and strains. Although the position of the physical surface fluctuates, the optical phase upon reflection can have reduced sensitivity to this motion. While practical implementation of such schemes for coherent compensation face certain challenges, we hope to stimulate further work on this important thermal noise problem.

C., Lev, B. L., Hudson, E. R., Stuhl, B. K., Lara, M., Bohn, J. L., Ye, J. 2007; 98 (25) Abstract We report magnetic confinement of neutral, ground state OH at a density of approximately 3 x 10(3) cm(-3) and temperature of approximately 30 mK. An adjustable electric field sufficiently large to polarize the OH is superimposed on the trap in various geometries, making an overall potential arising from both Zeeman and Stark effects. An effective molecular Hamiltonian is constructed, with Monte Carlo simulations accurately modeling the observed single-molecule dynamics in various trap configurations. Magnetic trapping of cold polar molecules under adjustable electric fields may enable study of low energy dipolar interactions.
