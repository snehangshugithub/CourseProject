Snchez-Rivera Assistant Professor of Biology Francisco J. Snchez-Rivera aims to understand how genetic variation shapes normal physiology and disease, with a focus on cancer. fsr@mit.edu Email Education PhD, 2016, Biology, MIT BS, 2008, Microbiology, University of Puerto Rico at Mayagez Research Summary The overarching goal of the Snchez-Rivera laboratory is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which genetic variation shapes normal physiology and disease, particularly in the context of cancer. To do so, we develop and apply genome engineering technologies, genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs), and single cell lineage tracing and omics approaches to obtain comprehensive biological pictures of disease evolution at single cell resolution. By doing so, we hope to produce actionable discoveries that could pave the way for better therapeutic strategies to treat cancer and other diseases. Francisco J. Snchez-Rivera will begin his appointment in early 2022. Awards Hanna H.
