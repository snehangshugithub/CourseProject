My research interests are in the areas of social and political philosophy and ethics. My most sustained research projects concern political liberalism and political legitimacy, educational justice, and the gendered division of labor. My book, Liberalism, Neutrality, and the Gendered Division of Labor, just came out with Oxford University Press. I've also written on issues of justice in higher education, on diversity problems within the discipline of philosophy, on the ethics and politics of abortion, on the use of social policy to curtail animal consumption and experimentation, on the practice of non-ideal theory in political philosophy, and on other issues in feminist philosophy Contact InformationEmerson 206gschouten@fas.harvard.eduWebsitesPersonal website Emerson Hall Harvard University 25 Quincy Street Cambridge, MA 02138 Phone: (617) 495-2191 Fax: (617) 495-2192 css-DepertmentIntranet css-pageTitle Admin Login OpenScholar Copyright 2021 The President and Fellows of Harvard College | Accessibility | Digital Accessibility | Report Copyright Infringement
