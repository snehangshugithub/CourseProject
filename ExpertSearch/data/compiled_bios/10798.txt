GROUP PAGE GOOGLE SCHOLAR Professional Background Postdoc, Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University; Ph.D., Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2016; B.S., Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, 2011. Research Synopsis The Bai lab focuses on both fundamental and applied study of soft materials and nanomaterials, design assembly and manufacturing approaches to enable hybrid integration of multi-materials towards high-performance electronic and photonic systems, develop new technology that can intelligently immerse electronics and photonics into biological systems, and create advanced tools and devices to address unmet clinical needs and improve human healthcare. The research at Bai lab covers many length scales, ranging from molecular/supramolecular self-assembly at nanoscale, to 3D organic-inorganic hybrid construction at microscale, and to multisystem integration at mesoscale. We enjoy designing and making devices and tools, and collaborative efforts are essential to our progress. Applied Physical Sciences lives in the collaborative space between science and engineering, combining knowledge and discovery with an engineering mindset, team-based science, and entrepreneurship to address real-world problems. The Department of Applied Physical Sciences believes that diversity, equity, and inclusion are crucial to our pursuit of excellence, and is deeply committed to creating a diverse and inclusive community.
