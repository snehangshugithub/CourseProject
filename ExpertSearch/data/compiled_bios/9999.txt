I was a faculty member at the Ecole Nationale Suprieure de Techniques Avances (Paris, France) from 1992 until 1999 and held part-time teaching appointments at Ecole Polytechnique in the Applied Mathematics Department and at Universit de Paris-I (La Sorbonne) in the Mathematics in Economy Program. In 1998, I was awarded the Bronze Medal for Engineering Sciences, from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, France. I joined the UC Berkeley faculty in April 1999 as an Acting Associate Professor, and obtained my tenure in May 2001. I was on leave from UC from July 2003 to 2006 to work for SAC Capital Management, a hedge fund based in New York and Connecticut.
