Doob Research Assistant ProfessorAffiliate, Illinois Quantum Information Science and Technology Center View CV Research Interests Tensor theory of operator spaces Tensor theory of operator systems Quantum information theory Operator algebras Research DescriptionMy research interests are in operator space theory, operator system theory, and quantum information theory. My recent work has been in using techniques from operator algebras to give new characterizations of correlation sets which arise naturally in quantum information theory. Graduate students are welcome to email me if you are interested in any of these topics.
