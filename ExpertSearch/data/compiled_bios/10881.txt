luty [HEFTI] Skip to page content Members HETheory Calendar Members News HESeminars Workshops Jobs Projects PublicLectures Markus Luty Research Interests My main research interest is in the theory of elementary particles, concentrating on physics beyond the standard model. Topics include supersymmetry breaking, extra dimensions, and non-perturbative physics. I have also worked on gravity and cosmology, for example the cosmological constant problem and consistent infrared modifications of Einstein gravity.
