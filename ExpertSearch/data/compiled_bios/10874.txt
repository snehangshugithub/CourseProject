Marua Brada Toggle navigation Home About/CV TEDx SurfsUp HFF Catalogs Physics of California Contact Marua Brada Originally from Slovenia, Marua is now a physics professor at UC Davis. Her research includes studying the composition of the Universe, her specialty being properties of dark matter, the elusive stuff" that makes up a quarter of the universe. Increasingly popular in the media especially with the excitement of the latest discoveries about the Universes past. Marua also studies first galaxies that formed in the Universe. The tools of her trade are telescopes in space (Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer Space Telescope) and on the ground in Hawaii (Keck). Marua uniquely combines her passion for the Universe with her outdoor loves of skiing, surfing and mountain biking. She is passionate about her research and is committed to provide the best possible education for her students. The one thing that excites her even more than her own research and the outdoors is seeing young and bright minds excited about the world around them. About/CV I am a Physics professor at University of California, Davis. Before I started to work here I was a Hubble Fellow at University of California, Santa Barbara, was spending my time as a Postdoctoral Research associate at Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) in Stanford, California. I did my PhD and graduate research at University of Bonn, Germany. My undergraduate years I spent partly in Bonn and partly in my home country Slovenia. More about my career you can find in my CV.

It is designed to image 10 fields to extreme depths with Spitzers [3.6] and [4.5] bands for 550 hours total. It also includes 13 prime and 13 parallel orbits of HST time for one of the clusters with missing deep WFC3-IR and optical HST data (RCS2-2327.4-0204). We are committed to the legacy of this program and plan to make all high-level Spitzer reduced data publicly available following publications. Below you will find links to the mosaiced images as well as PSFs. When using the data please quote both Bradac et al. 2014 (ADS reference or link), Ryan et al. 2014 (ADS reference or link) and Huang et al. 2016 (ADS).

Why can we actually ski, what allows us to turn, what makes our skis go fast? What are avalanches, how do they form? Physics of skiing videos! Surfing! Why is surfing in California better in winter than it is in the summer? And why do waves push us forward making surfing such a fun experience in the first place? . Scuba Diving! Why can we scuba dive and why do they always tell us not to hold our breath? Snowflakes! Why are snow flakes always six sided in nature (and eight sided only on holiday cards)? Marine life! Why do fish swim? Why do sharks sleep on the ocean floor? And so much more!
