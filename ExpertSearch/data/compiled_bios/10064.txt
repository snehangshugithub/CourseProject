To achieve this mission, my research group focuses on 1) designing novel energy storage materials for Li/Na/K-ion batteries, 2) developing scalable solid-state battery manufacturing, and 3) characterizing phase transformations at a fast timescale. It is our strength that we carry out highly interdisciplinary research at the intersection of materials science, inorganic chemistry, applied electrochemistry, and chemical engineering.Openings about RA and Postdoc positions are posted in the research website.Google scholar (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I7VUCawAAAAJ&hl=en)General InformationFall Office Hours: Tuesdays 10:00-11:30 am, or by appointmentSpring Office Hours: Tuesdays 5:00-6:30 pm, or by appointmentExperiencePostdoc: Materials Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (2015-2018)Postdoc: Materials Science and Engineering, MIT (2014-2015)PhD: Materials Science and Engineering, MIT (2014)Institutional ServiceCEMS Seminar Series ChairNew Certificate Program ChairResearch Committee MemberPhD Oral Qualifying Exam Committe MemberUndergraduate Ambassador MemberPhD Oral Qualifying Exam Committe MemberStevens-PSEG Partnership MemberCEMS Seminar Series ChairUndergraduate Ambassador MemberMeeting with US Army CCDC MemberPhD Oral Qualifying Exam Committe MemberCEMS seminar series ChairPhD Written Qualifying Exam Committee MemberPhD Oral Qualifying Exam Committee MemberCEMS seminar series MemberPhD recruitment event ChairPhD Written Qualifying Exam Committee MemberCEMS seminar series MemberCEMS seminar series MemberCEMS seminar series MemberProfessional ServiceReviewerMaterials Research Society Symposium Lead OrganizerMaterials Research Society Symposium Lead OrganizerReviewerManuscript ReviewerInternational Conference on Solid State Ionics Session ChairConsulting ServiceAppointmentsVisiting Professor, Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University (2020-Present)Professional SocietiesECS Electrochemical Society MemberMRS Materials Research Society MemberACers American Ceramic Society MemberSelected PublicationsJournal ArticleHan, J.; Kim, J.
