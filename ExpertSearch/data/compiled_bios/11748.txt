We focus specifically on the chemical tools or secondary metabolites that microbes use to navigate and alter their environment. Our work incorporates bacterial physiology, genetics, and genomics as well as mass spectrometry and other geochemical measurements.Selected PublicationsD.L. McRose and D.K. Newman.
