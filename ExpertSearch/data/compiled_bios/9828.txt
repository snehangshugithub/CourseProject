Turner joined the department in 2016 after seven years at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, CO. Prior to that, Dr. Turner was a Technical Staff Member at Los Alamos National Laboratories. Dr. Turner teaches classes in engineering design methods, design optimization, mechanical systems, computer-aided design/engineering/manufacturing, and design of complex systems. Dr. Turner is currently the Program Chair for ASMEs CIE Division Executive Committee and is a member of the International Design Simulation Competition Committee of ASME. In 2015, Dr. Turner won the CSM Design Program Directors Award at for service to the capstone design program. Dr. Turner regularly contributes to the ASME and ASEE design communities as well as the Design Society. Education PhD, The University of Texas at Austin, 2005 MSE, The University of Texas at Austin, 2000 BSME, University of Wyoming, 1997 Research Interests Dr. Turners research interests lie the field of Computational Design Methods, which lies in the intersection between computational capabilities and engineering design. His work includes computational methods to identify engineering design analogies, early design stage problem modeling, design optimization methods and tools, surrogate modeling, particularly for complex, nonlinear, uncertain systems, and manufacturing including additive manufacturing and intelligent, heterogeneous robotic and automation systems.
