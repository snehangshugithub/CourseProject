Prof. Jen Choys research focuses on the development of quantum sensing platforms and the application of nanoscale optics, photonics, and mechanics to improve the utility and performance of quantum sensors. Her research group will study and engineer light-matter interactions and coherence properties relevant to sensing in two material platforms: cooled neutral atoms and solid-state quantum emitters (e.g.,color centers in diamond and silicon carbide). This interdisciplinary research program will involve experimental atomic physics and optics, multi-physics modeling, materials development, and nanofabrication, and is intended to enable practical implementation of quantum instruments in precision navigation systems, clocks, and electromagnetic field and environmental sensors. Prior to joining UW-Madison, Jen was a Principal Member of Technical Staff at Draper Laboratory in Cambridge, MA, where she developed atomic and optical inertial sensors, and served as technical director on Drapers contribution to DARPAs Chip-scale Combinatorial Atomic Navigator (C-SCAN) program. Jen received her S.B. degrees in Physics and Nuclear Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2007, and her Ph.D. in Applied Physics from Harvard University in 2013.
