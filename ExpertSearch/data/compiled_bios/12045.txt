Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Biography I am a Professor and the CSEE deputy director of research at the University of Essex, Colchester, United Kingdom. Before that, I was senior researcher in the Signal Processing Laboratory (LTS4) at the Ecole Polytechique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland and the Communication and Distributed Systems Laboratory at the University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland. I received my Diploma (MSc equivalent) and the PhD degrees from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece. I was awarded the highly esteemed Ambizione career award from Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) in 2008 and 2011 for carrying out research on low computational complexity network coding for collaborative video streaming. I have been PI and co-I for a number of SNSF, Hassler foundation, and EU funded projects. I regularly serve as a member in technical program committees of international conferences. I am an elected member of IEEE MMSP Technical Committee (MMSP - TC) for the period 2019 - 2024. I served as the co-Chair of the Doctoral Symposium at ICIP'18, the Awards co-Chair at MMSP'17, the Publications Chair of IEEE workshop Packet Video 2012 and 2016. I was guest editor for Trans. on Emerging Telecommunication Technologies, SI: Spectrum extensions for 5G and beyond 5G networks. My research interests include machine learning for communications, multimedia communications, network coding, information-centric networking, networking, joint source and channel coding, video coding for machines, signal processing, and sensor networks. I am a Senior Member of the IEEE, a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy and Associate College Member of Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). Prospective PhD students interested in pursuing research in machine learning for communication, multimedia communications, network coding, networking, and multimedia sensor networks are encouraged to contact me by e-mail. If you are looking for a host institution for a Marie Curie IF on a topic related to my research interests, please send your CV to nthomos AT essex DOT ac DOT uk.
