Cha is a visiting professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Cornell University and will join as professor in July 2022. She received her Ph.D. in Applied Physics from Cornell University in 2009, working in Prof. David A. Mullers lab. She was a post-doctoral researcher in Prof. Yi Cuis group in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Stanford University. In 2013, she joined the faculty at Yale University in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Science, where she is currently the Carol & Douglas Melamed Associate Professor. Research in her lab focuses on synthesis and transport properties of topological and 2D nanomaterials and their phase transformations in order to understand the structure-electronic property relationships of quantum nanomaterials. Her work on topological and 2D nanomaterials started in 2010 as a postdoc at Stanford university. Since then, her group has expanded the class of topological nanomaterials under study, with a particular focus on achieving nanowires of topological superconductors and topological metals, which have implications for robust quantum computing and low-dissipation electronics. Research InterestsMy group focuses on studying novel electronic properties and phase transformations of nanoscale materials for device and energy applications. We have three research thrusts: A) nanowires of topological materials for potential quantum computing and low-resistance interconnects, B) two-dimensional (2D) materials for energy and electronic applications, and C) nanoscale effects on the phase transitions of our topological and 2D nanomaterials. My groups tool box includes 1) various growth methods to synthesize nanomaterials, 2) low-temperature magneto-transport measurements of nanodevices to probe the electronic properties, and 3)in situtransmission electron microscopy (TEM) to directly observe nanoscale phase transformations.
