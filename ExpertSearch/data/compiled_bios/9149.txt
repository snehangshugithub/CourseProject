He was a senior scientist at Insert Therapeutics, Inc. from 2001 to 2004, and a postdoctoral fellow at MIT from 2004 to 2005. He joined the faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2005 and is currently an Associate Professor of Materials Science and Engineering. He is a faculty affiliate of Department of Chemistry, Department of Bioengineering, Beckman Institute, Institute of Genomic Biology, Materials Research Laboratory, Micro- and Nanotechnology Laboratory, and University of Illinois Cancer Center. Professor Cheng was named as Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students at Illinois for five times in 2008-2010 and a Willett Faculty Scholar in 2013. Prof. Cheng is the recipient of a Prostate Cancer Foundation Competitive Award in 2007, a NSF Career Award in 2008, a Xerox Award for Faculty Research in 2010, and a National Institute of Health Directors New Innovator Award in 2010. He is currently an Associate Editor of Biomaterials Science. Research Statement Functional Polymers, Biomaterials, Nanomedicine Our research is focused on design, synthesis, characterization and evaluation of functional polymers and biomaterials. A broad scope of multidisciplinary areas is covered in our research, including materials science, organic and polymer chemistry, bioengineering and pharmaceutical science. We are interested in and working on the following specific research projects: Nanomedicines for improved cancer therapy, drug and gene delivery Cancer targeting with small molecules or nanomaterials. Polypeptide design, synthesis and applications; cell-penetrating peptides Functional and responsive polymers, such as self-healing, shape memory, degradation.
