LabDepartmentsChemical and Biological EngineeringEducationPh.D., Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, CA B.S., Chemical Engineering, with honors, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CAResearch InterestsWe are interested in understanding how molecular and cellular interactions give rise to collective behaviors in microbial communities. We use synthetic biology, quantitative microscopy, and microfluidics to directly investigate the molecular mechanisms behind how cells communicate across broad spatial and temporal scales. Our goal is to apply these principles to develop new synthetic biology approaches to biomedical problems through microbiome engineering.Selected PublicationsYang CY, Bialecka-Fornal M, Weatherwax C, Larkin J, Prindle A, Liu J, Garcia-Ojalvo J, Suel G.
