He specializes in: 1) Bone quality and fragility - developing improved understanding of the mechanisms that determine the mechanical behaviour and failure of bone and how collagen modifications due to ageing, disease, irradiation, and other causes alter these mechanisms and the mechanical behaviour of the tissue. 2) Engineering of bone mimetic materials for skeletal reconstruction by leveraging the exciting and rapidly advancing fields of additive manufacturing/3D Printing, biomineralization, and mechanics of multi-scale biological and biomimetic composites, researchers seek to gain improved understanding of the materials science and mechanics of these exceptional materials and to develop disruptive new technologies for application in skeletal reconstruction and repair (orthopaedics), particularly graft materials for treating large skeletal defects caused by trauma, cancer, etc.Research InterestsMechanics of Biomaterials and TissuesBoneBiomechanicsBiomaterialsBiomedical EngineeringBone Quality and FragilityAdditive ManufacturingOrthopaedics/OrthopedicsMechanical testingFracture mechanicsCollagenTissue EngineeringEducation2008, Doctorate, Biomedical Engineering, Dalhousie University2003, Master's, Mechanical Engineering, Queen's University2001, Bachelor's, Mechanical Engineering, Queen's UniversityCourses*BME 161 - Intro to Biomedical DesignTaught in 2016, 2017BME 182 - Physics II - DynamicsTaught in 2017, 2018BME 355 - Anatomical Systems ModellingTaught in 2019BME 401 - SeminarTaught in 2020BME 402 - SeminarTaught in 2019, 2021BME 461 - Biomed Eng.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
