Toward this end, we are mapping the RNA-binding affinity spectra of dozens of human RNA-binding proteins and integrating this information with in vivo binding and activity data. We are also studying the functions of 3 untranslated regions, including their roles in mRNA localization and microRNA regulation. The lab uses a combination of computational and experimental approaches to address these questions.
