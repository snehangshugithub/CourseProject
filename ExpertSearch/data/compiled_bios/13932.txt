Young Professor of Biology; Member, Whitehead Institute Richard A. Young explores how and why gene expression differs in healthy versus diseased cells. 617-258-5218 Phone WI-501 Office young@wi.mit.edu Email Lab Website Mary Anne Donovan Assistant 617-258-5217 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1979, Yale University BS, 1975, Biological Sciences, Indiana University Research Summary We use experimental and computational technologies to determine how signaling pathways, transcription factors, chromatin regulators and small RNAs regulate gene expression in healthy and diseased cells. Our interests range from the basic molecular mechanisms behind gene control to drug development for cancer and other diseases caused by gene misregulation.
