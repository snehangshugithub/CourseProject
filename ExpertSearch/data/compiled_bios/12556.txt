All student surveys are usually coordinated with or developed by the faculty's Quality Management & Accreditation department. Every semester, we collect detailed feedback of courses with more than three participants, which helps lecturers to identify strengths and weaknesses of their courses. Oustanding lecturers are honoured during our annual faculty feast "Dies Academicus". In addition, we conduct surveys at critical points of the student life cycle, e.g. freshmen or alumni surveys. Survey results are then discussed within the faculty, especially with our Academic Deans. Course evaluation results are open to the public and are displayed right outside the Dean's Office.
