Parallel Programming, MoWe 2:00PM - 3:29PM, Soda 306 Biography Katherine (Kathy) Yelick has been a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley since 1991 and has held a joint research appointment at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) since 1996 where she is currently the Associate Laboratory Director (ALD) for Computing Sciences. Her research focuses on parallel programming languages, automatic performance tuning, performance analysis, parallel algorithms, and optimizing compilers, and she currently leads the Berkeley Unified Parallel C (UPC) project and co-leads the Berkeley Benchmarking and Optimization (Bebop) group. As the ALD for CS at Berkeley Lab, she oversees the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), the Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) and the Computational Research Division (CRD), which covers applied math, computer science, data science and computational science. She was leader of the Future Technologies Group from 2005 through 2007 and the NERSC Director from 2008 through 2012.
