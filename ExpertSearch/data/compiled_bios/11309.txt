Experimental Campaign on EAST - Testing LiMIT and flowing liquid lithium. Teaching Statement Teaching is probably the most important aspect of life. Weather we do it professionally or outside of the classroom, every person in one shape or form is teaching those around them in some way. Lifes experiences teach us and in turn we teach those around us with our experiences, becoming part of life.As someone who has the privileged of teaching in the classroom I always want to make sure that my students will get the greatest knowledge out of what I say and that they have learning it. Where possible I not only want to teach the theoretical side of a subject but I always make sure that the students have a firm understanding of the practical aspect. This last part I try to achieve in two ways. One is through real world examples where I can show through a website or media to demonstrate something, but also I like to take the students in the lab and show them, have them obtain a hands on experience with different subjects.As an example I teach an introductory plasma class. Throughout the semester I do demonstrations with various laboratory plasma sources where I can show them the breakdown curves for plasmas as well as the different components of a plasma. I was able to show them how sputter coating works where I ran a magnetron discharge for 10 min and deposit copper onto a stainless steel washer. This one always amazes the students. But I do get to show them a fusion device, HIDRA, which always excites the students. I also try to show students where plasmas are used in everyday life and the impact the technology has on our lives.With all this in mind I believe that students need to come out of the class being able to think for themselves and asks good questions. An informed person is someone that will make good decisions and should be able to separate fact from fiction I like to think that I contribute to people being informed which allows them to make good decisions. I believe that I am a fair and engaging instructor that is able to connect with students and give them a passion and open their eyes to a whole new world. I believe that making the effort to spend even just a little time to work with students and get to know them can help them learn new things and to become the best that they can.

There is a very poignant graph that has the CIA World Fact book puts out: It is the Human Development index with respect to Electricity use per capita. What it shows is that the quality of life in a country is directly related to the amount of power available. Industrialized countries such as the USA, Germany, Canada, Australia, Japan and the UK are all well above 0.9 and have greater power usage > 6MWh/year per capita. This is why you see countries such as India and China on a power plant building spree. They are below < 2MWh/year per capita. These countries need energy to bring their people up to the standards of the USA and Europe.Any future power sources will be dictated by energy and environmental factors and will have three criteria: the need to be carbon neutral, sustainable and also provide the much needed constant large base power. Renewable technologies currently will only fulfill one or two of the three criteria. Nuclear fusion offers all three. It is not a carbon burner, thus does not release carbon products into the environment, the deuterium and lithium fuel needed to power these devices has billions of years worth of reserves in the earth oceans thus it is sustainable. Last it can run at base loads of 1 2 GW similar to current power plants and can provide it constantly. Thus the endeavor of my career is to facilitate the development of nuclear fusion as a viable source of energy in the future.Plasma physics and material science has the unique ability to challenge us in ways never conceived nor imagined and this has always inspired and driven me. Future advancements in fusion will use lithium in the vessel to reduce the recycling and handle power loads to the divertor. Developing technologies that will safely handle and deliver lithium into a fusion device are crucial and this is something that I have been working with the last few years at the University of Illinois. I believe that I can lead research into lithium technologies and expand efforts further into this area. Post-Doctoral Research Opportunities Opportunities exist to work on HIDRA and lithium PFC development and plasma material interaction studies. Graduate Research Opportunities Opportunities for Graduate students to perform experiments at the forefront of fusion technology. These include, plasma material interaction studies, lithium PFC development and working on collaborative national and international experiments such as NSTX-U (at PPPL, Princeton), EAST (at ASIPP, China) and industry partners. Undergraduate Research Opportunities There are several opportunities for undergraduate students to work on HIDRA. The tasks involve helping the grad students and myself to plan and set up experiments, to help with taking data and analysis. The ability to learn about vacuum, plasma, lithium, materials and aspects of fusion (tokamak and stellarator) on a toroidal fusion device is a great opportunity for keen students wanting to go into the plasma sciences. Research Interests Dr. Daniel Andruczyk is an Assistant Research Professor in the Nuclear, Plasma and Radiological Engineering department and is heading up the HIDRA toroidal fusion device at the University of Illinois. He currently is an Assistant Research Professor at the Center for Plasma-Material Interactions, a multidisciplinary center at the University of Illinois. Prof. Andruczyk conducts research into fusion plasma edge, PFC materials and their relationship in controlling the performance of the plasma. He also does research related to manufacturing in the semiconductor industry and non fusion plasma's. Previously he was a Research Engineer at the Princeton Plasma Physics Labs from 2012 - 2014. Prof. Andruczyk also previously worked as a post-doc at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, Greifswald where the W-7X Stellarator operated. He has extensive expertise in plasma diagnostics including the development and running of diagnostic He beams and has installed two on H-1NF Heliac in Canberra, Australia and the WEGA Stellarator in Greifswald, Germany. Prof. Andruczyk was one of the architects in obtaining the WEGA device from MPIPP Greifswald, he took apart, transported and assembled the device in Illinois here it has been renamed the Hybrid Illinois Device for Research and Applications (HIDRA). The role of HIDRA is to continue plasma edge studies and to test new plasma facing materials (PFM) and plasma facing components (PFC) in particular using flowing and static liquid lithium as the material of choice to reduce the wall recycling rate, impurity suppression, heat flux removal and tritium extraction and re-use. HIDRA will be almost exclusively used to purely do PMI, which is something lacking in the worlds fusion devices right now and will look to develop, test, integrate and establish viable plasma facing components that will be installed on larger fusion devices, e.g. EAST. The HIDRA group maintains many strong national and international research links. Domestically he has collaborations with Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and several other institutions where they do research into plasma facing components for EAST as well as divertor design for EAST and other machines. Several local companies such as Edittek LLC and Star Fire Industries also work with Prof. Andruczyk. Internationally, the EAST device located at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Hefei is a large collaborator as are Tokamak Energy in the UK and also General Fusion in Canada. Daniel is always looking for new opportunities to expand his research and knowledge, not just in fusion but other applications for plasma.
