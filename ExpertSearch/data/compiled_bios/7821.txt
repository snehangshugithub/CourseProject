He was a postdoctoral associate at MIT (1972-74) and a Robert E. Millikan Fellow at Caltech (1974-77). Professor Bodek joined the University as an Assistant Professor of Physics in 1977. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1980 and to Professor in 1987. Professor Bodek was appointed as an Alfred P. Sloan Fellow (1979-81); NSF-JSPS Fellow, KEK, Japan (1986); and Fellow of the American Physical Society (1985). He served as a project director at the Department of Energy (1990-91), was Associate Chair (1995-98) and then Chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy (1998-2007) and served on the editorial board of the European Physics Journal C. Professor Bodek was awarded the 2004 APS W.KH. Panofsky Prize in Experimental Particle Physics "for his broad, sustained, and insightful contributions to elucidating the structure of the nucleon, using a wide variety of probes, tools, and methods at many laboratories." In 2004, Professor Bodek received the University of Rochester Award for Excellence in Graduate Teaching. His doctoral thesis provided some of the evidence of the quark's existence that was the basis for the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physics.Research OverviewProfessor Bodek's research interest is in the field of ExperimentalHigh Energy Physics. For his PhD, he worked under professors Henry Kendall and Jerome Friedman on the MIT-SLAC deep inelastic electron scattering experiments that provided evidence for the quark structure of matter; the1990 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Friedman, Kendall, and Taylor for these experiments.Professor Bodek's research interests are in the physics of W's, Z's, Dileptons at hadron colliders (CDF, CMS) at Fermilab and at the Large Hadron Collider; neutrino physics and neutrino oscillations (CCFR/NuTeV/MINERVA at Fermilab); deep inelastic scattering and nucleon structure (JUPITERat Jefferson Lab). In the area of instrumentation, Professor Bodek's research is in the area of scintillating tiles electromagentic and hadron calorimeters.Professor Bodek's research group is involved in theCDF, CMS, andMINERVA) experiments. He is also the co-spokesperson of the Jefferson Lab JUPITER program (experiment E04-001). In CDF, his group has built the CDF plug upgrade hadron calorimeter. ForCMS his group has constructed the HCAL hadron calorimeter. Both calorimeters were constructed using tile-fiber technology. Currently, he research is focused on precision measurement of the electroweak mixing angle at CMS), and in the measurements and modeling of neutrino and electron scattering cross sections on nucleons and nuclear targets.For a INSPIRES up-to-date summary of of Bodek's publications click herehere.The following are links to articles on Professor Bodek's research:(a) Gluon Spin(Fermilab Today 11-05-26)(b) Quark Speed(Fermilab Today 10-7-15)(c) Getting a charge from asymmetry (Fermilab Today 07-10-11).(d) 2004 Panofsky Prize Awarded to Fermilab User Arie Bodek(Fermilab Today 03-10-01)Selected PublicationsJournal ArticlesComparison of optical potential for nucleons and Delta resonances in electron scattering from nuclear targetsArie Bodek and Tejin CaiEur.Phys.J.C 80 (2020) 7, 655Measurement of the weak mixing angle using the forward-backward asymmetry of Drell-Yan events in pp collisions at 8 TeVCMS Collaboration (Albert M.
