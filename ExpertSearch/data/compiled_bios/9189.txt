Perry is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and an Affiliate of the Materials Research Laboratory. She received her Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from Northwestern University in 2009, for investigating interfacial transport behavior in nano-ionics with Thomas O. Mason. After this she joined the Energy Frontier Research Center for Inverse Design as a postdoctoral fellow developing p-type transparent conducting oxides and synthesizing missing materials. From 2012-2014 she was a postdoctoral researcher at the International Institute for Carbon-Neutral Energy Research (I2CNER) at Kyushu University, Japan, and a visiting scholar at MIT, working with Harry L. Tuller. From 2014-2017 she served as a WPI Assistant Professor in I2CNER and as a Research Affiliate at MIT, where her research focused on mixed ionic and electronic conducting oxides for high temperature electrochemical energy conversion and storage. She joined the University of Illinois in January 2018 and has since built a research group focusing on tailoring and understanding point defect-mediated properties in electro-chemo-mechanically active oxides. Her research has been recognized with a NSF CAREER Award, DOE Early Career Award, JSPS Kakehni Awards, IUMRS Award for Encouragement of Research, J. Bruce Wagner, Jr. Award from the Electrochemical Society, and the Edward C. Henry Award of the American Ceramic Society.

A fundamental understanding of these point defect-mediated properties needs to be developed in order to enable rapid, rational design of optimized solid state ionics for improved device performance. Particularly, there is benefit in moving beyond conventional electro-chemical studies to consider the coupling between electrical, chemical, and mechanical states of materials, such as the lattice strain occurring upon non-stoichiometric composition changes during operation (chemical expansion) and the impact of strain on transport. Our recent work has been focusing on development of design principles for high anion/cation conductivity, fast oxygen/steam surface exchange kinetics, and the resulting chemical expansion in perovskite-structured ceramics that breathe. We measure surface oxygen exchange kinetics on model thin films fabricated by pulsed laser deposition, using in situ ac-impedance spectroscopy and a novel optical transmission relaxation technique. Controlled variation of overall film defect chemistry, outermost surface chemistry, orientation, and microstructure has enabled a better understanding of the relative importance of each. We study chemical expansion behavior across multiple length scales using in situ X-ray and neutron diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and dilatometry, with comparison to atomistic computational simulations. Such studies have enabled identification of structural and operational factors that can be applied to tailor chemical expansion behavior. We apply ac-impedance spectroscopy, equivalent circuit analysis, and microstructure models like the nano-Grain-Composite Model to evaluate and separate local interface/bulk ionic and electronic transport and polarization in bulk ceramic, thin film, heterostructured, and nanostructured materials. Overall, approaches to lower the chemical expansion coefficients (for durability) and increase the surface exchange kinetics and ionic/electronic transport (for efficiency) are being actively researched.
