In his dissertation, he constructed examples of CAT(0) cell complexes on which certain classes of Coxeter groups act without global fixed points. From 2011 to 2015, Dr. Patterson served as the director of the University of Arizona's Center for Recruitment and Retention of Mathematics Teachers, which provided induction coaching and professional development for over 400 K-12 teachers of mathematics in the Tucson metropolitan area. He has also remained active in the mathematics competition community, serving as the chair (2017-2018) of the Question Writing Committee for MATHCOUNTS, the largest contest in the United States for middle school students, and serving as an Associate Editor for the American Invitational Mathematics Examination. Dr. Patterson's research investigates secondary students' and teachers' mathematical meanings for concepts and procedures in high school algebra, such as solving equations and graphing quantitative relationships. He is the recipient of a National Science Foundation DRK-12 award (#1908825) for the project "Reasoning Language for Teaching Secondary Algebra (ReLaTe-SA)". I enjoy mathematics because of the endless opportunities it provides for exploration of abstract structure, as well as the power it offers for explanation of natural phenomena. There are few things I enjoy more than getting wrapped up in a problem, especially when the problem is simple enough to explain to a classroom full of children and can be explored using mathematical techniques ranging from the elementary to the exotic.
