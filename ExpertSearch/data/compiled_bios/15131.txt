Current research interests or projects focus on the following aspects in the areas: 1. Analysis, modeling, and architecture design of collaborative and virtual organization for sharing and retrieving user generated contents in collaborative learning; use of aspect-oriented approach in collaborative software learning; analysis of hypergraph models for behavioral and contextual semantics in collaboration systems; analysis and design of human-machine collaborative interaction and adaptive interface. 2. Design and analysis of self-regulated learning for software programming and language training; analysis and design of software execution semantics and ontology to enhance knowledge sharing for learning programming languages. 3. Use of compositional theory and interface semantics technology in real-time systems for the development of function block based control applications.[top]PublicationsJournal Articles Xiaokun Zhang and Osama Ahmad, Weaving proactive pedagogy agents into adaptive software components (in progress) Xiaokun Zhang and Osama Ahmad, Towards runtime tagged components and hypergraph-based collaboration for collaborative programming, (in progress) Xiaokun Zhang, Jon Dron, Kinshuk, Goran Jelica, and Peter Holt, Engage tagged learning activity networks with collaborative programming, (in progress) Robert W.
