Fisher Faculty Professor, Department of Applied Physics and Professor, By Courtesy, of Materials Science & Engineering Sites Stanford ProfileGroup WebsiteDescription of Interests: Condensed Matter Physics Our research group is based in the Geballe Laboratory for Advanced Materials at Stanford University. In broad terms, we study materials with unconventional magnetic and electronic properties, with the general aim of obtaining a deeper understanding of the many effects that can emerge from electron correlation. We employ several techniques to grow high-quality single crystals of materials of interest. Experiments probe the thermodynamic and transport properties of these materials, often in high magnetic fields. Current interests include superconductivity, electronic nematic order, aspects of quantum magnetism, and the behavior of electrons in low-dimensional materials.
