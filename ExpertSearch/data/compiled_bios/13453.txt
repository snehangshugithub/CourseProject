Radosevich Associate Professor of Chemistry Research Areas Office2-321Phone617-253-4503Emailaradosev@mit.eduAdministrative AssistantBetty Lou McLanahanAssistant Phone617-253-0630Lab Website Research in the Radosevich group centers on the invention of new homogeneous catalysts and reagents based on inexpensive and earth-abundant elements of the p-block. Specifically, the group has designed a class of phosphorus-based molecular catalysts with small frontier orbital energy gaps and dense spatial orbital array that make and break chemical bonds by catalytically cycling in the PIIIPV redox couple. Ongoing research pursuits are motivated by both a fundamental mechanistic interest in redox reactivity, as well as a practical need for new efficient and environmentally-friendly chemical processes. Professor Radosevichs research program spans the areas of inorganic, organometallic, and organic chemistry, with a focus on synthesis and catalysis. Students and postdoctoral researchers joining the group can expect to develop a range of synthetic skills spanning these subdisciplines. By coupling synthetic expertise with rigorous training in the characterization of new compounds (including NMR, UV-Vis, IR, EPR, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemistry), new molecular entities with exciting and useful reactivities are anticipated.
