Our first research thrust targets the need for biomimetic organs-on-a-chip to advance personalized medicine. In this area, we are employing origami-based manufacturing strategies to mimic complex 3D tissue structure and function in a multi-functional but simple-to-fabricate microfluidic platform. A second thrust focuses on the need to combine structural stiffness and strength with effective damping for aerospace, personal protection, and other systems. To address this challenge, we are creating and demonstrating new classes of lightweight, high-strength, viscoelastic, carbon-based nanomaterials. Our third thrust focuses on creating actuators that are compact but powerful enough for use in human-scale applications (assistive technologies, flow control, energy harvesting, etc.) In this area, we are combining the precision of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) with the high forces and displacements of macroscale actuation to create for example tactile displays enabled by motion amplifiers and electrically-controlled fluid actuation.
