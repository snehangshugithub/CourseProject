Prior to joining MIT, she was a tenured Associate Professor in the Faculty of Medicine at McGill University, Montreal, Canada. Her research is focused on understanding how the skin senses the environment and determining how it can be used effectively as a medium of communication. Her work on tactile displays includes research on characterizing the properties of different actuators used in displays, building and testing different types of tactile displays, evaluating the mechanical properties of skin so as to quantify its responses to vibration and human perceptual studies in which responses to mechanical stimulation of the skin are quantified. The wireless tactile displays designed and fabricated in her laboratory have been used by a number of research groups in academia and industry interested in assessing the feasibility of using tactile displays in different applications ranging from target search and localization with robotic swarms to cuing soldiers regarding impending dangers. Related to this work is her research on thermal displays which includes developing thermal models that characterize the interaction between the hand and an object, building and testing thermal displays and conducting psychophysical and physiological studies with human subjects to assess the validity of the thermal models implemented in the displays. This research has been extended to examining how thermal feedback can be incorporated in multisensory displays and used as a channel of communication. She has demonstrated the feasibility of using thermal feedback in such applications and described novel perceptual features associated with these inputs.
