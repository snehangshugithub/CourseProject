Associate Engineer (7/87-4/88), Engineer (4/88-8/90), Senior Project Engineer (8/90-8/94) Other Professional Activities Co-Founder and Scientific Advisor, IntelliWheels, Inc., Champaign, IL, May 2010 January 2018 Research Statement I direct the Human Dynamics and Controls Laboratory (HDCL) in the Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering. Our research group uses methods from design, control theory, mechatronics, pneumatics and soft robotics, musculoskeletal biomechanics, and movement analysis. The HDCL focuses on investigating and improving movement control and function through two main areas: assistive device development and locomotion biomechanics. The HDCLs interest in assistive device development stems from a desire to improve function and the quality of life of persons with disability. Research Interests Locomotion biomechanics Robotic medical training simulators to mimic patients with movement disorders, soft pneumatic robotic projects, wearable sensors for movement and anxiety detection, rolling mobility devices Design and control of mechatronic devices in healthcare Research Areas Dynamics & Controls Health and Bio Selected Articles in Journals Fox, M.C., Konigsberg, L.W., Hsiao-Wecksler, E.T., Whitcome, K.K., and Polk, J.D.
