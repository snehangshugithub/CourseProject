Espinosa, "Microfluidic Device for Stem Cell Differentiation and Localized Electroporation of Postmitotic Neurons" Lab on a Chip, 14 (23), 44864495, 2014.In the Classroom Professor Espinosa has taught a variety of courses, including Introduction to Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), Experiments in Micro/Nano Science and Engineering, Experimental Engineering, Elasticity, Damage and Inelasticity of Advanced Materials, Advanced Computational Mechanics, Mechanics of Materials, and Aircraft Structures. His teaching philosophy addresses issues that require particular attention in modern education: (a) the increasingly international world of business and markets; (b) the technological advances that are continuously raising the speed at which information is obtained and transmitted; and (c) the dynamics of the job market that makes likely that most individuals will enjoy several careers in their lifetime. It is his view that a student-centered curriculum in which the student takes responsibility for her or his education rather than a rigid and static core curriculum is the best choice for the future. Such a curriculum maximizes multidisciplinary course work, independent study and research (honor degrees), and encourages experimentation and intellectual expansion.
