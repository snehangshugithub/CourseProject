Qualifications PhD The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, (2019) Research and professional activities Research interests Developing novel Natural Language Processing and Graph Representation Learning techniques for modelling health related data This research aims to develop a series of improvement works for NLP and GRL in clinical data and other health-related data that will provide: 1. Adapt Responsible Research & Innovation (RRI) methods to start the interdisciplinary clinical data science and NLP works in Essex. 2. Prototype a person-centered supervised model training process to refine definitions and expose and explore tacit and latent knowledge in psychotherapy assessment. 3. Identify the key factors contributing to performance and trust in the model pipeline (data, processing, deployment) by examining domain expert requirements for the qualities of an engaging, interactive feedback interface and eliciting broader concerns about its acceptability. 4. Assess whether patient and practitioner knowledge base in developing a digital mental health decision support tool increases performance and trust in it.
