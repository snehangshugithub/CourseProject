Previously, he served as an assistant specialist at HNEI (2005-2007) and as an engineer at Ford Motor Company (2001-2005) on hybrid electric, fuel cell electric, and battery electric vehicle programs as well as in the Environmental Quality Office. Dr. Davies has a diverse engineering background with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Carnegie Mellon University, 2001), a M.S. in Interdisciplinary Engineering (Purdue University, 2004), and a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering (Georgia Tech, 2014). His experience has included physics-based modeling (electrochemistry, electrical, thermal, and fluids), embedded controls, data analytics and optimization, model-based systems engineering, and product development (both hardware and software). Dr. Davies research broadly involves complex engineered systems that support the generation and utilization of renewable energy. Current topics include data acquisition, modeling, and controls for the electric grid under high penetrations of variable renewable energy (wind and solar). Recently he led the development of a low-cost, high-fidelity distribution transformer power monitor that provides real-time data analytics and controls at the grid edge (ARGEMS project). Ongoing work (as of 2019) involves how ARGEMS can be integrated with power flow and system models, solar forecasting, and distributed energy resources (DERs) to provide or enhance grid services. He also leads the implementation of detailed distribution circuit models and real-world photovoltaic (PV) profiles onto HNEIs power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) testbed as a part of the UI-ASSIST program. He has developed and implemented new methodologies for studies of high solar and wind penetrations on Hawaiis electric grids and has served on HNEIs steering committee for the same. Dr. Davies welcomes opportunities to mentor and advise students on energy- and modeling-related research and career opportunities. He has served as instructor for undergraduate projects (EE 396 and EE 496) and Electric Power Systems (EE 435). Funded undergraduate and graduate opportunities may be available.
