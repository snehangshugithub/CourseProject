UR Department of Mathematics - Arnold Pizer Arnold Pizer, Professor Emeritus Department of Mathematics University of Rochester Rochester, NY 14627 Office: Hylan 802 Phone: (585) 766-8812 Fax: (585) 273-4655 E-mail: apizer@math.rochester.edu Biographical Sketch Prof. Pizer received his B.A. in Mathematics (1967) from Yale University, and his Ph.D. in Mathematics (1971), also from Yale. His thesis advisor was T. Tamagawa. He was an Acting Assistant Professor at UCLA (1971-73) and an Assistant Professor at Brandeis (1973-76) before joining the University as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics in 1976. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1978 and to Professor in 1989. In 2007 he became Professor Emeritus. Research Prof. Pizer's research interests are in the field of Number Theory. Prof. Pizer is particularly interested in the study of the arithmetic of quaternion algebras and its connections to modular forms, Brandt matrices, Hecke operators, and Ramanujan graphs. Much of his work has been related to the "Basis Problem" which involves constructing explicit bases for spaces modular forms from theta series attached to quaternion algebras and determining the action of Hecke operators on such bases. Currently he is interested in developing a "ray class" ideal theory for orders in quaternion algebras in analogy with ray class" theory in number fields and the application of such a theory to Ramanujan graphs. Prof. Pizer is also has a pedagogical interest in using the internet for mathematics education. He is a codeveloper, together with Prof. Gage, of the homework delivery system WeBWorK.
