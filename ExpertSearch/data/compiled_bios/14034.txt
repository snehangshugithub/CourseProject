A common thread in his work is the idea/claim/speculation that a logic (a way of drawing inferences) spontaneously grows and latches on to the syntactic structures produced by our capacity for recursive computation. This natural logic gives a special power to our ability to use language to communicate and refer, a power not found in other species. Some more specific recurring themes/obsessions are properties and predication (control/raising/ de se attributions), Noun Phrase structure (quantified vs. bare nominals, mass vs. count), anaphora and presuppositions, implicatures and polarity phenomena. He is also very interested in pursuing these topics by experimental means.Contact Informationchierch@fas.harvard.edup: 617-495-8181WebsitesPersonal websiteResearch InterestsPhilosophy of language Emerson Hall Harvard University 25 Quincy Street Cambridge, MA 02138 Phone: (617) 495-2191 Fax: (617) 495-2192 css-DepertmentIntranet css-pageTitle Admin Login OpenScholar Copyright 2021 The President and Fellows of Harvard College | Accessibility | Digital Accessibility | Report Copyright Infringement
