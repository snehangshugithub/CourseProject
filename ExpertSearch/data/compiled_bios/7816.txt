We have projects studying large-scale plate and mantle motions in the Pacific, Africa and High Arctic. Our archeomagnetic work is focused on southern Africa. Our studies of the oldest magnetic fields and the early Earth are based on field studies in South Africa, Swaziland, Australia and Canada. Opportunities are available for students with Earth Science backgrounds with the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences and with degrees in Physics through the Department of Physics and Astronomy.
