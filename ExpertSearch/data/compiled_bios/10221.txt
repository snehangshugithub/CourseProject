His research uses a multiscale experimental and computational approach to evaluate the in vivo loading environment, tissue properties, and microstructural structure-function relationships of tissues that function in complex physiologic environments.Studies conducted by Lake's research group in the Musculoskeletal Soft Tissue Laboratory aim to enhance fundamental understanding of healthy tissue properties, elucidate changes that occur in (and mechanisms responsible for) injury/disease, and provide guidelines for improved treatment/replacement strategies. While focused primarily on tendon and ligament of the upper extremity (i.e., shoulder and elbow), these studies also have broad applicability towards understanding properties and relationships of many different native and engineered soft tissues. Biography Professor Lake joined Washington University in St. Louis in 2012. Previously, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow and supervisor of the Tissue Mechanics Laboratory in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Minnesota. His doctoral research was conducted in the McKay Orthopaedic Research Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, and his undergraduate degree is in Bioengineering from the University of Utah. In the News Lake elected a Fellow of ASME Fellows are selected for their engineering achievements and experience in the field. 07.23.2021 Mechanical role of elastic fibers in tendons to get closer look Spencer Lake and Robert Mecham lead a team using imaging to study function of elastin in tendons. 02.12.2021 Lake to use machine learning to better understand elbow injury Spencer Lake's lab will study elbow injuries from the cellular level using noninvasive imaging. 01.15.2021 Find more news about Spencer Lake Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Instagram YouTube Engineering Departments Biomedical Engineering Computer Science & Engineering Division of Engineering Education Electrical & Systems Engineering Energy, Environmental & Chemical Engineering Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science Sever Institute - professional degrees Technology & Leadership Center - training for industry Contact Us Washington University in St. Louis McKelvey School of Engineering MSC: 1100-122-303 1 Brookings Drive St. Louis, MO 63130-4899 Contact Us Resources COVID-19 Resources Canvas Directory Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Emergency Management Engineering IT Maps & Directions Make a Gift WebFAC / WebSTAC 2021 Washington University in St. Louis.
