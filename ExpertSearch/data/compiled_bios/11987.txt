While he is interested in fundamental physical, hydrological and geochemical questions, much of his work also has strong applied aspects. The scale of his research ranges from detailed examination of hydrological dynamics and biogeochemical pathways to watershed and landscape studies. Professor Rezanezhad has extensive field experience in wetland ecosystems, monitoring water levels, soil and water quality, as well as contaminant, nutrient, and greenhouse gas fluxes. He has recently developed and implemented a number of novel techniques in the lab, including automated water table fluctuating soil column system, automated freeze-thaw cycle soil column system, an automated flow injection switch-box, different pore water sampling devices, and high resolution electrochemistry sensors, for innovative research projects. These techniques improve currently available bench scale systems for validating and accurately addressing physical and chemical heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales. Results from these systems can be used to develop models of hydrogeochemical processes, which will improve solute transport modelling reliability.
