I have also frequently done collaborative fieldwork elsewhere, studying both oceanic and nearshore faunas, and deep sea as well as shallow-living forms, moving toward a global sense of the biology, ecology, and biodiversity of (especially) medusae and ctenophores. I work primarily at the population and individual levels, but also at the ecosystem level including analysis of large and small-scale macroplankton community structure (relying on submersible or ROV observations).

Edmondson, UW Zoology 1974, 1976-77 M.S. Zoology, Florida State University 1976, Richard N. Mariscal, advisor Ph.D. Biology, University of Victoria (Canada) 1982, George O. Mackie, advisor Miscellaneous courses taken at Skagit Valley College (in Friday Harbor) 1986-present Flute 1960- ; oboe 1994- ; marimba 2003- I have been resident at the University of Washington's Friday Harbor Laboratories since 1978, but was a visiting post-doc or researcher for several-month stints in New Zealand, at the Station Zoologique in Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, at the Station Biologique in Roscoff, France, and at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution in Florida. I have typically gone to sea on about one oceanographic cruise per year and feel extremely fortunate to have had many opportunities to observe and contemplate the open ocean and deep-sea up-close, in situ, on numerous dives in manned submersibles and using state-of-the-art ROVs (Remote Operating Vehicles).
