I work in the MOSS lab under the supervision of Prof. Douglas P. Holmes.My current research involves aspects of theoretical and applied mechanics relevant to controlling the shape of thin shells by coupling geometry and swelling. I am interested in studying the behavior of soft active materials such as gels and biohybrid systems based on muscular thin films (MTFs) that can have intriguing applications in biomimetics and soft robotics. I work among solid mechanics, differential geometry and swelling and I am interested in developing reduced models to study the morphing of thin structures via analytical, numerical and experimental methods.
