Duquette David J. Duquette John Tod Horton Professor of Engineering Materials Science and Engineering duqued@rpi.edu http://www.rpi.edu/dept/cie/faculty_duquette.html Professor Duquette received his Ph.D. in metallurgy and materials science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1968. Following his graduate work, he performed research on elevated temperature materials at the Advanced Materials Research and Development Laboratory of Pratt and Whitney Aircraft, joining the Rensselaer faculty in 1970. He is the author or co-author of more than 160 scientific publications, primarily in the areas of environmental degradation of materials and electrochemical processing of semiconductor interconnects.
