DeVoe Professor of Management and Organizations; Area Chair Theres something very powerful about putting a precise monetary value on time. sanford.devoe@anderson.ucla.edu (310) 206-8205 /sites/default/files/document/2021-08/DeVoe_CV_August_2021.pdf Areas of Expertise: Behavioral Decision Making Human Resource Management Organizational Behavior About Biography Publications Chapters & Blog Biography Biography Sanford DeVoe is professor and area chair of Management and Organizations. He is currently teaching leadership foundations and organizational behavior to Full-Time, Fully-Employed, and Executive MBA students. DeVoes research focuses on the psychological consequences of placing a monetary value on time. Using both a mix of survey and experimental methods, he observes how people look at the tradeoffs between time and money and how each is valued. The key implication of his research is how organizations can be changed to enhance the well-being of individuals, organizations and society. DeVoe earned his bachelors degree in psychology with high honors from Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. While pursuing his Ph.D. in organizational behavior from Stanfords Graduate School of Business he received numerous fellowships and awards. He received the Excellence in Teaching award six times, in addition to being named winner of the Deans Award for Excellence in Research in 2011 at the University of Torontos Rotman School of Management, where he worked for eight years prior to joining the faculty at UCLA Anderson in summer 2015. DeVoe serves on the editorial board of four academic journals, includingAcademy of Management Journal,Journal of Personality and Social PsychologyandOrganizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes. A sought-out expert, DeVoes research has been cited in numerous media outlets including the Economist, Financial Times, New York Times, New Yorker, Time Magazine and Wall Street Journal. He was also featured as one of Poets and Quants Best 40 Professors Under 40 in 2015. A native New Yorker, DeVoe came to UCLA because it has attracted one of the best group of behavioral scientists in the world, situated at one of the best public universities in the country, in one of the most vibrant cities in other words, a no-brainer. When hes not in the classroom he enjoys playing tennis as well as traveling. The overlap of these two interests has inspired the goal of seeing all four Grand Slam tournaments he only has one to go!
