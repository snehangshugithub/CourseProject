He graduated from Nanjing University with a BS in Physics in 1982, and from Brown University with a Ph.D. in Physics in 1998. He joined Yale University in 1987 for post-doctoral training, was appointed as Associate Professor in 1997 and then came to University of Rochester, becoming a tenured full Professor in 2004 in Radiology, Physics and Biomedical Engineering. Dr. Zhong has over 25 years experience in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) physics, engineering and biomedical/clinical/neuroscience applications, with over 130 publications. He is one of the leading researchers for complex relaxation and diffusion effects and interactions of magnetic susceptibility and diffusion in tissues, application of diffusion in brain electrical activities and functions, and is one of the major inventors for intermolecular multiple quantum coherence brain imaging. He also has played leadership roles in international organizations, service in U.S. and international funding reviews and reviewing in leading scientific funding agencies and journals. Dr. Zhong is a grantee of many national and private funds, awardees in research excellence by the NIH, Yale and University of Rochester, and he owns 5 U.S. patents. In recent years, Dr. Zhong's research has focused on brain diffusion tensor imaging, quantitative analysis of brain functional imaging and network analysis, fast MR imaging techniques and their applications of MRI and MRI in neuroscience, translational medicine and individual imaging analysis.CredentialsEducation1982BS | Nanjing University, ChinaPhysics1984MS | Brown UniversityPhysics1988PhD | Brown UniversityPhysicsPost-doctoral Training & Residency09/1987 - 12/1989Postdoctoral Fellow Yale University School of MedicineAwards2004Dean's Award for Excellency in Research, University of Rochester2000Summa Cum Laude Citation, the American Society of Neuroradiology1999Certificate of Merit Citation for Scientific Exhibit, Radiological Society of North America1994The Dean's Award, Yale University School of Medicine1992The FIRST Award, NIH1988 - 1990NIH research fellowship.1982 - 1987China US Physics Examination and Application) scholarship, Brown University.VIEW ALL expand_morePatentsPatent Title: System and Method for Three-Dimensional Interleaved Water and Fat Image Acquisition with Chemical-Shift Correction Patent #: 6,373,249 Issue Date: Apr 16, 2002 Country: United States Invented By: Wingchi E Kwok, Saara Totterman, Jianhui ZhongPatent Title: Optimized Orthogonal Gradient Technique for Fast Quantitative Diffusion MRI on a Clinical Scanner Patent #: 6,288,540 Issue Date: Sep 11, 2001 Country: United States Invented By: Zhong Chen, Wingchi E Kwok, Jianhui ZhongPatent Title: Intermolecular Multiple-Quantum MR Imaging in Humans Patent #: 6,528,997 Issue Date: Mar 04, 2003 Country: United States Invented By: Zhong Chen, Wingchi E Kwok, Jianhui ZhongPatent Title: Interleaved Water and Fat Dual-Echo Spin Echo Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Intrinsic Chemical Shift Elimination Patent #: 6,583,623 Issue Date: Jun 24, 2003 Country: United States Invented By: Wingchi E Kwok, Saara Totterman, Jianhui ZhongPatent Title: Cryogenically Cooled Phased Array RF Receiver Coil for Magnetic Resonance Imaging Patent #: 7,002,348 Issue Date: Feb 21, 2006 Country: United States Invented By: Wingchi E Kwok, Zhigang You, Jianhui ZhongPatent Title: Cryogenically Cooled Phased Array RF Receiver Coil for Magnetic Resonance Imaging Patent #: 6,825,664 Issue Date: Nov 30, 2004 Country: United States Invented By: Wingchi E Kwok, Zhigang You, Jianhui ZhongVIEW ALL expand_morePublicationsJournal Articles10/12/2021Faiyaz A, Doyley M, Schifitto G, Zhong J, Uddin MN.
