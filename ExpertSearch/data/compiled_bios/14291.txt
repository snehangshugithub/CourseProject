Visiting Associate, Caltech, 1999-2000; Professor, 2000-07; Kavli Professor, 2007-; Deputy Chair, 2010-15; Director, 2014-. Research Areas: Physics; Mathematics Curriculum vitae Research Interests Ooguri is a theoretical physicist working on quantum field theory, quantum gravity, and superstring theory. His research strategy is to discover mathematical structures in these theories and to exploit them to invent new theoretical tools to solve fundamental questions in physics. In particular, he developed the topological string theory to compute Feynman diagrams of superstring theory and used it to solve mysterious quantum mechanical properties of black holes. He also worked on conformal field theory in two dimensions, D branes in Calabi-Yau manifolds, the AdS/CFT correspondence, properties of supersymmetric field theories and their relation to superstring theory, and constraints of consistency of quantum gravity to its low energy effective theory.
