More specifically, he works in the areas of decision-based design (linking consumer preferences and enterprise-level objectives with the engineering design process), uncertainty quantification and management, and complex system design. Areas of technical expertise include uncertainty propagation methodologies, Bayesian statistics and modeling, stochastic consumer choice modeling, optimization, and design automation. Prior to returning to academe, Dr. Hoyle spent 15 years in industry as a project engineer and engineering manager, concerned primarily with electronics packaging and with managing the trade-offs between performance, manufacturability, and cost.
