Other studies focus on floristics, biogeography, and the conservation of rare species, including golden paintbrush (Castilleja levisecta). Peter Dunwiddie is an ecological consultant, affiliate professor in the Biology Department, and associate curator in the Burke Museum Herbarium at the University of Washington. He has worked as a botanist and ecologist for conservation organizations in Washington and Massachusetts after receiving his doctorate in botany at the University of Washington in 1983. Prior degrees include a masters degree in geography from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a bachelors degree in environmental studies, also from the University of Wisconsin. He is the author of several books, and has published numerous scientific papers in a variety of fields, including ecological restoration, fire ecology, conservation biology, invasive species management, the conservation of rare species, Quaternary paleoecology, and dendrochronology. As a consultant, he has most recently worked with the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, US Fish and Wildlife Service, the US Army Corps of Engineers, the San Juan Islands National Monument, Washington State Parks, and the San Juan Preservation Trust on diverse problems relating to the management of conservation land, rare species recovery, control of invasive species, and the ecological use of prescribed burning.
