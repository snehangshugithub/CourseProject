Thompson Assistant 617-253-5193 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1971, Harvard University BA, 1964, Biology, Harvard University Research Summary Nancy Hopkins became an assistant professor at MITs Center for Cancer Research in 1973. She used genetics to map RNA tumor virus genes, identifying genes that determine host range and the type and severity of cancers mouseretrovirusescause. These genes included capsid protein p30 and transcriptional elements now known asenhancers. Hopkins switched research areas more than a decade later, developing tools for zebrafish research and devising an efficient method for large-scaleinsertional mutagenesis. Using this technique, her lab identified and cloned 25% of thegenesessential for a fertilized zebrafish egg to develop into a swimming larva. These genes included known and novel genes that predispose fish to cancer. Currently, Hopkins works onadvocacy for cancer prevention and early detection research.
