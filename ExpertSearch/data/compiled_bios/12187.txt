Prior roles include grants management at the Texas State Library & Archives Commission and technology management at the Texas Library Association. Chris also served in multiple roles from 1997 2006 in the US Library Program at the Gates Foundation. His research interests include how public libraries support cultivating, producing, and sustaining local knowledge; how public libraries participate in and leverage open data ecosystems for the benefit of their communities; and how serendipity happens in the intersections of physical and digital spaces in which public libraries operate.
