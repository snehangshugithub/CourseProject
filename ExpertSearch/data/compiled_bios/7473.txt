Fox and Dorothea Doctors Fox Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Professor of Neuroscience, Director of Biology and Medicine Overview After earning a PhD in physics at Brown, Prof. Paradiso was a Miller Research Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley and an associate scientist at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute in San Francisco. He joined the Brown faculty in 1990 and is Director of Brown's Center for Vision Research. His research investigates brain mechanisms underlying vision. He is the Chairman of the National Eye Institute's Central Visual Processing Study Section which reviews federal grant submissions for vision research. He is Principal Investigator of a Training Grant from the National Eye Institute that supports graduate training in vision research. He serves on the editorial boards of the Journal of Vision and Vision Research and for many years sat on the executive committee of the Vision Sciences Society. He is coauthor, with Drs. Mark Bear and Barry Connors of a leading introductory neuroscience textbook, which has been translated into 6 languages. He is presently course director of NEUR 0010 (Introduction to the Brain), which is one of the most popular courses at Brown. He has won the Elizabeth H. LeDuc Award for Teaching Excellence in the Life Sciences and the Brown University Undergraduate Council of Students Award for Excellence in Teaching.

Research Research Overview Humans are highly visual animals and the processing of visual information appears to involve a significant fraction of the brain. Vision involves interactions between neurons spread widely across the brain and it dynamically adapts to the needs of ongoing behavior. The aims of Dr. Paradiso's research are to elucidate the encoding of visual information in cerebral cortex, the computations performed by interacting neurons, and the adaptive use of neural circuitry, with the goal of understanding the mechanisms underlying human visual perception. Research Statement Despite its seeming simplicity, visual perception involves neural computations in numerous cortical areas throughout the brain. Through the combined use of brain recordings and perception experiments, we investigate the computations performed by areas of cerebral cortex involved in vision. Of particular interest are the encoding of information ultimately leading to visual recognition and the dynamic use of visual areas of the brain to serve ongoing behavior.
