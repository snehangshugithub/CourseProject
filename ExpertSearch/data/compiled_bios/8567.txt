Background: Developed medical expert systems for NASA, led a team of people representing common sense knowledge for the Cyc Project Education PhD in Medical Informatics from Stanford University, and MS in Computer Science from the University of Texas. Research: Wanda Pratts research is motivated by the problems patients face in finding, using, and managing information. Her research includes studying patients work to understand their problems, developing new types of technology to address those problems, and evaluating the technology with patients. She is also interested in using technology to improve patient-physician communication and collaboration. Currently accepting new PhDstudents. Not accepting MS students at this time.
