University of California, Davis, 1991 Ph.D. University of Oregon, 1996 Postdoctoral Associate, Univ., of Minnesota, 1996-1997 NIH Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Arizona, 1998-2000 Phone: (801) 585-7957Office: 2532 TBBCEmail: conboy@chem.utah.edu Research GroupInterfacial and Bioanalytical Chemistry (IBAC) Research Interests The Conboy Group is actively developing novel analytical and bioanalytical techniques for the exploration of interfacial phenomena in biology and chemistry. We are currently pursuing research into the dynamics and structure of lipid membranes and the development of label-free methods for detecting protein and small-molecule adsorption to interfaces. Our laboratory uses a combination of nonlinear optical spectroscopies in conjunction with biological and electrochemical methods to achieve these objectives. Please peruse the selection of publications from our group listed below for more information about our research.
