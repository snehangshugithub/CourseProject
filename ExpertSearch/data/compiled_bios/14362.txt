Chemical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, 2010 B.S. (high distinction) Chemistry, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, 2006 B.Ch.E. (summa cum laude) Chemical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, 2006 Research Statement The Holmberg research group is devoted to the development and study of new functional nanomaterials that have the potential to be produced in a scalable and cost-effective manner. We focus on inorganic nanostructures, such as nanowires and nanocrystals, synthesized via scalable solution-based and supercritical fluid-based processes, with an emphasis on nanomaterial growth, assembly, and integration. A portion of our laboratory is currently devoted to the development and study of new types of flexible, high-rate, high-capacity battery materials, with the remainder focused on magnetic, plasmonic, and photonic nanomaterials.
