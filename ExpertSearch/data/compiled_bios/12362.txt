Ragon Institute, Room 762 (400 Technology Square) Office hmoura@mit.edu Email Education PhD, 2011, University of So Paulo Heart Institute MSc, Molecular Biology, 2008, University of Brasilia BS, 2005, Biology, University of Brasilia Research Summary By utilizing an innovative and intersectional approach, our lab main goal is to reveal fundamental immune-related pathways that modulate organ and tissue physiology. Our work will help to develop new strategies to tune these molecular pathways in health and disease, leading to the development of much-needed therapeutic approaches for human diseases. Hernandez Moura Silva will begin his appointment in early 2022. Awards CAPES Thesis Award - Brazil, 2012 Key PublicationsLeukocyte Heterogeneity in Adipose Tissue, Including in Obesity.
