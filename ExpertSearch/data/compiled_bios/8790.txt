WATCH VIDEO Ooblecks weird behavior is now predictable Associate Professor Ken Kamrin has developed a model that predicts how a cornstarch-water mixture turns from liquid to solid and back. The model could predict how mixtures behave in military and industrial applications. READ MORE New scaling law predicts how wheels drive over sand By using toy models and scaling laws, Associate Professor Ken Karmin can predict how wheels on trucks, tanks, and even Mars rovers move through sand.
