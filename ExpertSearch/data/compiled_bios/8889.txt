Her research empirically explores governance of sociotechnical systems, as well as outcomes, inequality, and consequences within these systems. Using mixed-methods, including computational social science approaches and institutional analysis, she addresses research questions about: participation in and legitimacy of sociotechnical governance; social justice issues associated with sociotechnical governance; privacy in sociotechnical systems; and differences between policies or regulations and sociotechnical practice. Her work practically supports decision-making in, management of, and participation in a diverse public sphere. Madelyn studied environmental studies, international studies, political science, and Spanish at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (BS) and Information Science at Indiana University, Bloomington's School of Informatics and Computing (MIS, PhD). She is currently an affiliate of the Ostrom Workshop at Indiana University and was previously affiliated with AI Now and the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. Prior to joining the iSchool at Illinois, she was a postdoctoral research scholar at the Information Law Institute at New York University's School of Law, where she studied knowledge commons governance and collaborated with the Privacy Research Group, as well as a postdoctoral IT policy fellow at the Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP) at Princeton University, where she collaborated around privacy and user experiences in sociotechnical systems, including mobile platforms and IoT.
