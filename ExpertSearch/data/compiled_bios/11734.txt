Stuart S. Berr, Professor of Biomedical Engineering Our laboratory is involved with developing magnetic resonance (MR) techniques as a tool for basic biomedical research. We have developed noninvasive, non-contrast-enhanced methods for imaging blood perfusion, demonstrated to be effective in imaging blood flow to the kidneys, lungs, heart, and brain in humans. We were also the first to demonstrate the feasibility of imaging the lung using hydrogen-based MR methods. We have also been developing micro-imaging techniques for the study of the heart and vascular system in mice and rats. This project has been particularly challenging due to the high spatial and temporal resolution requirements.
