Jon Robinson, UC Santa Cruz Jonathan Robinson Professor of Economics Department of Economics UC Santa Cruz 457 Engineering 2 Santa Cruz, CA 95064 jmrtwo@ucsc.edu Welcome to my webpage! I am a development economist and most of my projects are field experiments in rural Africa. My recent research focuses on market access for farmers, and on evaluating the effect of financial access. At UCSC, I teach undergraduate and Ph.D. classes in development economics. CV Working papers Private but Misunderstood?
