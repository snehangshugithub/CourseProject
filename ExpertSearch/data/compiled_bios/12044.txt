I am particularly interested in Uncertainty management, Risk Analysis and Computational Finance. I am also strongly interested in the area of Internet of Things including Intelligent Environments, ubiquitous computing, pervasive computing, ambient intelligence, intelligent buildings and embedded agents. In addition, I am also strongly interested in the areas of intelligent robotics and the intelligent control of industrial processes. I have published over 300 papers in top International Journals, Books and Conferences. I hold Six Industrial international patents in the field of computational intelligence and its applications to intelligent control, energy management, decision support and data analysis of industrial processes, financial markets and medical applications. I have strong relations with industry and major companies which allows for the dissemination of my research to the commercial and industrial sectors thus resulting in real world products and services with strong impact on the wider society. I maintain a sustained performance in winning external research funding where I was the principal investigator and co-investigator of many projects which received funding from the Innovate UK, European Commission, the UK Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), UK Technology Strategy Board (TSB), UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), UK Economics and Social Sciences Research Council (ESRC), the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (IB-BMBF), the Taiwan National Science Foundation, Korea-UK Science and Technology fund and many industrial companies . I am Fellow IEEE, Fellow IET and Principal Fellow HEA. I have served as the General and Programme Chair of numerous major international conferences where I was the General co-Chair of the 2007 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, London, UK, July 2007 and acted as the Programme Chair of the 2017 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, Naples, Italy. I serve as an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, the International Journal of Robotics and Automation, the Journal of Ambient Computing and Intelligence and the International Journal of Soft Computing. I was also selected to serve on the editorial board of the International Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments. I have been invited to deliver keynote speeches in numerous major international conferences.
