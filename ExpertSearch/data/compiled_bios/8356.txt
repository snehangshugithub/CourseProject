These studies have begun to reveal insights into how the release machinery is regulated and thereby contributes to neuronal plasticity. Neuronal exocytosis is triggered by Ca2+ and occurs via the abrupt opening of a pre-assembled fusion pore. Subsequent dilation of the pore results in the complete fusion of the vesicle membrane with the plasma membrane. We are currently identifying and reconstituting the sequential protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions that underlie excitation-secretion coupling. To delineate this pathway, we have primarily focused on the Ca2+-binding synaptic-vesicle protein, synaptotagmin, which appears to function as the Ca2+-sensor that regulates release. Neuron | Click to enlarge Our work is also focused on components of the SNARE-complex, which is thought to form the core of the fusion apparatus. The rapid kinetics of exocytosis (<1 ms) indicate that only a handful of molecular rearrangements occur to couple Ca2+-synaptotagmin to the opening of the fusion pore. We are using a combination of biochemical, biophysical, imaging, spectroscopic and genetic approaches to delineate the interactions/conformational changes that occur during this window of time. Current experiments include the reconstitution of Ca2+-triggered membrane fusion in vitro, visualization of protein rearrangements and vesicle dynamics inside living cells, genetic manipulations to modulate the efficiency of synaptic transmission, time resolved electrophysiological studies to dissect individual steps in the release pathway and to manipulate the properties of the exocytotic fusion pore, and imaging approaches to monitor sub-quantal exocytosis.
