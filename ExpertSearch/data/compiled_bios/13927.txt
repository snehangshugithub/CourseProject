Baker E. C. Whitehead Professor of Biology; Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Tania Bakers current research explores mechanisms and regulation of enzyme-catalyzed protein unfolding, ATP-dependent protein degradation, and remodeling of the proteome during cellular stress responses. 617-253-3594 Phone 68-523 Office tabaker@mit.edu Email Lab Website Gina Lee Assistant 617-324-7833 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1988, Stanford University BS, 1983, Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison Research Summary Our goal is to understand the mechanisms and regulation behind AAA+ unfoldases and macromolecular machines from the "Clp/Hsp100 family" of protein unfolding enzymes. We study these biological catalysts using biochemistry, structural biology, molecular biology, genetics, and single molecule biophysics.
