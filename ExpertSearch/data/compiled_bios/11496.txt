Research in the group will span from the fundamental study of self-assembly, phase-separation, and interfacial phenomena of polymers in complex fluids such as microemulsions and lyotropic liquid crystals, to the formation of multi-functional, three-dimensionally mesostructured materials, and the development of fully interdigitated complex device architectures such as three-dimensional solid-state batteries.
