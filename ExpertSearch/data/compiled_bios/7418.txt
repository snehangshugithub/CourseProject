B.Sc., Mathematics, University of British Columbia, Canada, 2005. Research Interests I am an applied mathematician, who uses and develops tools to address problems in science and engineering. My mathematical work draws on many areas of pure and applied mathematics, but areas of particular interest include stochastic analysis, statistical mechanics, computational geometry, and rigidity theory. My scientific work focuses mainly on modeling physical systems, including those in materials science, fluid dynamics, soft-matter physics, geophysics, and oceanography. Selected Publications M.
