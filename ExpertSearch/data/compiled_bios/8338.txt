He also investigates hydrodynamic stability vortex shedding and chemically reacting systems. He is currently working to develop proper orthogonal decomposition models of dynamic flight maneuvering using virtual control surfaces generated by trapped vorticity.Professor Pearlstein discovered multi-valued stability boundaries in hydrodynamic stability problems, showed that they were associated with closed neutral curves, and physically explained their origin. He also developed a theoretical/computational approach for predicting nonuniform molecular weight distributions in materials produced by free-radical photopolymerization, accounting for propagation and termination kinetics, monomer diffusion and nonuniform light absorption.
