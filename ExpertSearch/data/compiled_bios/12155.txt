He holds a BSc in Chemical Engineering and BSc in Mathematics from Colorado School of Mines, MS in Chemical Engineering from the University of Colorado-Boulder, and PhD in Chemical Engineering from Purdue University West Lafayette, Indiana. The goal of his research program is to develop theory and applications for process systems engineering. The applications are focused on planning and scheduling of process operations, energy production, pollution monitoring and control, waste minimization, carbon management, sustainable operations, molecular design, and product formulation. Professor Elkamel teaches graduate and undergraduate courses on optimization techniques, mathematical methods for chemical engineers, applied statistics, numerical methods, systems engineering, and engineering economy. Prof. Elkamel supervised over 90 graduate students (of which 35 are PhDs) and more than 30 post-doctoral fellows/research associates and his trainees all obtain good jobs in the chemical process industry and in academia. He has been funded for several research projects from government and industry. Among his accomplishments are the Outstanding Faculty Award, the Best teacher award, the IEOM (Industrial engineering and Operations Management) Outstanding Service and Distinguished Educator Award, UAE MBR Academy of Scientists, The Engineering Research Excellence Award, and Excellence in Graduate Supervision Award. He has been on the program and organization committees of many international conferences. Prof. Elkamel has a strong track record of research excellence. He published over 330 journal articles, 145 proceedings, and 33 book chapters, and has been an invited speaker on numerous occasions at academic institutions throughout the world and at national and international conferences. He has also written 5 books, including Environmentally Conscious Fossil Energy Production, Planning of Refinery and Petrochemical Operations, and Electric Vehicles in Energy Systems: Modelling, Integration, Analysis, and Optimization.Research InterestsProcess Systems Engineeringplanning and scheduling of process operationssupply chain managementproduct and process designpollution prevention and waste minimizationwaste utilization and managementplanning for energy productionrobust optimizationsoft computingEnergy and Environmental Engineering SystemsAir Pollution ModelingSimulation and ControlRefinery modelingplanning and optimizationSustainable Development of the Petrochemical IndustryDynamic Modeling and OptimizationCombinatorial OptimizationUncertainty in OptimizationProcess Modeling and SimulationComputer-Aided Product Formulation and DesignEducation1993, Doctorate, Chemical Engineering, Purdue University1989, Master's, Chemical Engineering, University of Colorado-Boulder1987, Bachelor's, Mathematics, Colorado School of Mines1987, Bachelor's, Chemical Engineering, Colorado School of MinesCourses*CHE 220 - Process Data AnalysisTaught in 2016CHE 322 - Num Methd Process Anls DesgnTaught in 2016CHE 482 - Chemical Engineering DesignTaught in 2016CHE 571 - Industrial EcologyTaught in 2016, 2020CHE 720 - Tpcs in Chemical Proc AnalysisTaught in 2016CHE 725 - Res Tpcs in Chem Proc AnalysisTaught in 2016, 2017, 2020, 2021NE 215 - Probability and StatisticsTaught in 2016, 2019, 2020* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsA.
