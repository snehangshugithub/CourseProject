Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CAResearch InterestsPolymers are ubiquitous in applications ranging from everyday household items to organic electronic devices and functional biomaterials. Key to the end-use application are the nanoscale structure and the processing pathways required to attain that final structure. Our group seeks to understand the fundamental processes that govern the self-assembly of nanostructured polymers and other soft materials. We use recent innovations in advanced optical microscopy techniques to observe materials below the optical resolution limit, opening polymer science to the advantages of optical characterization even at the relevant nanometer length scales. For example, these techniques can directly monitor the dynamic evolution of polymer morphology in situ in real time. Our group will use these methods for developing new polymeric materials, with a particular emphasis on biomaterials and biohybrid molecules.Selected PublicationsChen, Yusu; Wang, Qifeng; Mills, Carolyn E.; Kann, Johanna G.; Shull, Kenneth R.; Tullman-Ercek, Danielle; Wang, Muzhou, High-Throughput Screening Test for Adhesion in Soft Materials Using Centrifugation, ACS Central Science 7(7):1135-1143.Zhang, Ruimeng; Qiang, Zhe; Wang, Muzhou, Integration of Polymer Synthesis and Self-Assembly for Controlled Periodicity and Photonic Properties, Advanced Functional Materials 31(1).Zhang, Ruimeng; Qiang, Zhe; Wang, Muzhou, Integration of Polymer Synthesis and Self-Assembly for Controlled Periodicity and Photonic Properties, Advanced Functional Materials 31(1).Li, Lingqiao; Qiang, Zhe; Chen, Xi; Jin, Kailong; Wang, Muzhou; Torkelson, John M., Impact of bottlebrush chain architecture on Tg-confinement and fragility-confinement effects enabled by thermo-cleavable bottlebrush polymers synthesized by radical coupling and atom transfer radical polymerization, Journal of Polymer Science 58(20):2887-2905.Qiang, Zhe; Wang, Muzhou, 100th anniversary of macromolecular science viewpoint, ACS Macro Letters 9(9):1342-1356.Silvaroli, Anthony J.; Heyl, Tyler R.; Qiang, Zhe; Beebe, Jeremy M.; Ahn, Dongchan; Mangold, Shane; Shull, Kenneth R.; Wang, Muzhou, Tough, Transparent, Photocurable Hybrid Elastomers, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces 12(39):44125-44136.Qiang, Zhe; Li, Lingqiao; Torkelson, John M.; Wang, Muzhou, Determining order-to-disorder transitions in block copolymer thin films using a self-referencing fluorescent probe, Molecular Systems Design and Engineering 5(1):330-338.Chan, Jonathan M.; Wang, Muzhou, Toward Artificial Tissues That Are Both Soft and Firm, ACS Central Science 6(3):339-341.
