Crandall Professor Emeritus Home Find Faculty Jeff R. Crandall Bio M.E. Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, University of VirginiaPh.D. Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, University of Virginia Professor Crandall served as the Director of the Universitys Center for Applied Biomechanics from 1994 to 2019. His research focuses on understanding human response and injury with applications in automobile safety, sports, and military protection. He has extensive experience with experimental biomechanics spanning the length scales of tissue samples to whole body cadavers. Prof. Crandall has been integral in the development of advanced dummies including THOR and the Polar Pedestrian dummy as well as in the evaluation of numerous frontal and side impact adult and child dummies. He was the principal investigator for the Global Human Body Pelvis and Lower Extremity Center of Excellence. He has been involved in CIREN for nearly 20 years, first as a subcontractor (Maryland, National Childrens Medical Center, INOVA) and then as PI for the UVA/INOVA CIREN Center. He is a fellow of SAE and the AAAM, past-president of AAAM, and the current president of the International Research Council on Biomechanics of Injury (IRCOBI). He has authored more than 500 technical papers and has received numerous awards including the United States Government Award for Engineering Excellence.
