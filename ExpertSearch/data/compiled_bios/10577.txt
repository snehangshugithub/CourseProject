Kostuk is a professor of electrical and computer engineering and optical sciences. Upon completing his PhD from Stanford University, prior to joining the University of Arizona, he spent a year at the IBM Research Center in Almaden, California. Kostuk's primary area of expertise is holographic concepts, materialsand applications. He currently is investigating the application of holography and low coherence techniques to medical imaging problems. Other projects include: optical coherence tomography and the use of volume holograms for obtaining spatial and spectral information from biological tissue; the use of holographic optical elements to realize compact non-conventional solar photovoltaic concentrators; and holographic techniques to enhance the optical collection efficiency of low cost photovoltaic cells with laminate nanostructures and to develop holographic spectrum splitting concentrators. He is member of IEEE and a fellow of the Optical Society (OSA)and SPIE, the international society for optics and photonics. He served as the holography associate editor for Applied Optics, and recently served as the co-chair of the SPIEholography working group.
