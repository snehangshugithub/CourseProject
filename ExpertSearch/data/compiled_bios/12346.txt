We generate genetically engineered mice, and analyze them through multiple methods including molecular and cellular biology, electrophysiology, microscopic imaging, optogenetic engineering, and behavioral studies. Ultimately, we aim to detect the effects of our manipulations at multiple levels in the brain deducing which behaviors or cognitions are causally linked to specific processes and events taking place at the molecular, cellular, and neuronal circuit levels.
