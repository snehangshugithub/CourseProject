Majda Professor Emeritus of Mathematics jonjon@cims.nyu.edu 212-998-3323 Warren Weaver Hall, Office 902 http://math.nyu.edu/faculty/majda Education Ph.D., Mathematics, Stanford University, USA, 1973. M.S., Mathematics, Stanford University, USA, 1971. B.S., Mathematics, Purdue University, USA, 1970. Research Interests My current research interests center around stochastic statistical behavior of turbulent dynamical systems in climate atmosphere ocean science. I blend math theory, qualitative and quantitative models, design numerical algorithms, and combine with physical reasoning to gain new insight into extremely complex systems. My recent projects include Mutli-scale modelling and data assimilation for turbulence and clouds in the tropics, new strategies for prediction using information theory, capturing intermittency in large data sets, and uncertainty quantification for complex systems. I like to work with graduate students and post docs. Selected Publications A.J.
