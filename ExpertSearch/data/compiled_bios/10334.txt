He received his PhD in Aerospace Engineering from the Technical University of Madrid in 2015 on the use of graph theory to unravel the dynamics of chaotic patterns in fluids. From 2016 to 2020, he was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Stanford University working on high-fidelity simulations of external aerodynamic applications. His research is focused on solving outstanding problems in physics & modeling of turbulent flows using transformative tools and creativity. His work includes turbulence theory & modeling by artificial intelligence, information theory, and quantum computing, with applications ranging from UAVs and commercial airliners to hypersonic vehicles. He is the recipient of the Milton van Dyke Award from the American Physical Society (2017), the Center for Turbulence Research Fellowship from Stanford University (2016), and the Da Vinci Award for the top five European dissertations on Fluid Mechanics (2015).
