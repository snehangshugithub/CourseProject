He is also Chair of the Medical Devices Program, Professor of Surgery in the Faculty of Medicine, Professor of Engineering in the School of Information Technology and Engineering, and Professor in the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies at the University of Ottawa and Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Carleton University. He established the Medical Devices Commercialization Centre (Networks of Centres of Excellence of Canada), a collaborative network of medical devices stakeholders, to develop and commercialize viable, safe, reliable, effective and needed medical devices for success in the global clinical market. He has been actively involved in the medical devices field for over 25 years in Canada and internationally. Background Dr. Mussivand received his undergraduate education and training in engineering and management. Following many successful years in senior positions in government, crown corporations and the private sector, he received his doctorate in Medical Engineering and Medical Sciences at the University of Akron and Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine. Thereafter, he joined the internationally acclaimed Cleveland Clinic Hospital and Research Foundation, where he gained invaluable knowledge and experience in the development of medical devices, artificial hearts and cardiac care. In 1989, he was invited to return to Canada to continue his pioneering work in the field of medical devices. Dr. Mussivand has achieved national and global recognition. His breakthroughs have resulted in prominently situating Canada in the fields of medical devices, artificial hearts, remote power transfer and in situ sterilization. Combining his scientific, management and business expertise, Dr. Mussivand has chaired and served as a member on several boards, and he has been a CEO of several successful corporations. His leadership has been responsible for creating over 1,000 man years in the Canadian workforce and has been the catalyst for an influx of more than $600 million, primarily from outside Canada, during the past 10 years.

Research & Clinical Interests Clinical Dr. Mussivand has utilized his multidisciplinary background in pioneering 36 major discoveries and breakthroughs including 12 worlds firsts and leading technologies, including: Artificial Heart: He is a world leader in artificial hearts and enabling technologies. He pioneered development of the first pulsatile ventricular assist device that is implantable (in the chest) that can be remotely powered, monitored, and controlled. Guidelines/Solutions: Advanced application of devices through research and publications providing practical technological and scientific solutions for patient complications. Thermal Therapy: Advanced the visionary concept based on thermal energy transfer in order to trigger the bodys own natural healing mechanisms. Alzheimer and Blood flow Relation: Research on the methodology of fluid flow visualization of blood flow patterns led to the publication of an important and original hypothesis in Alzheimers research. Blot Clot Prevention: Pioneered a novel method for quantifying blood flow patterns, velocities and shear forces measurements and optimizing designs to prevent thrombosis. This is now a standard procedure utilized in the development of blood conducting devices (valves, artificial hearts, conduits, etc.). Optimized Power Transfer to the Human Body: Introduced, optimized non-invasive electronic systems for transferring power through intact skin/tissue (protecting body from invading pathogens) for implanted medical devices. Monitoring/Control: Pioneered remote patient monitoring and device control systems utilizing electronics and communication technologies for medical devices. First person to accomplish transatlantic transfer of patient/heart data, and demonstrated this worlds first technology at the G7 in Brussels and in Tokyo. This work received international acclaim including ABC World News with Peter Jennings entitled Medicine on the Outer Edge. Fingerprints DNA: Developed a method and devices based on engineering microfluidics and electric field generation to rapidly sample and extract NDA from invasive and non-invasive samples (e.g. from fingerprints) in 15 minutes. This innovation was named a breakthrough in Readers Digest. In Situ Sterilization: Conceived a novel approach and device to reduce or eliminate medical device infections. This advancement could significantly reduce human suffering and cost of infections with implantable medical devices and resolves a major problem for the healthcare system. Research Dr. Mussivands areas of interest and contributions includeartificial hearts (mechanical circulatory support devices) as treatment for heart failure, remote power transfer for implantable medical devices, remote patient monitoring (telemedicine), biofluid dynamics to reduce/eliminate thrombosis in blood conducting devices, patient care simulation centre, detection devices and methods for detection, in situ sterilization, medical devices (failure analysis and regulatory process) and medical sensors.
