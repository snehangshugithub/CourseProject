Lyons University Endowed Professor, Physics Location:Olin Engineering Building102 Phone:757-727-5277 E-mail:drdrlyons@gmail.com Education:B.S., Grambling State UniversityPh.D., 1982, Stanford University Research Interests:The present focus of my research is in the area of nonlinear effects in optical fibers. In particular, I am studying UV induced photorefractive effects in optical fibers with an emphasis on the use of the resulting Bragg reflection filters for distributed sensing, telecommunications, and medical applications. In addition, studies involving interferometric fiber optic sensors with applications to smart materials and structures are also a primary focus. This study is an outgrowth of research which I conducted while working as a staff physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory between 1985 until 1990. It has since grown into one of the most exciting areas in fiber optic research and has gained a great deal of momentum in the telecommunications industry. In my teaching responsibilities, I emphasize the realization that the responsibility for the complete education of the students rests upon my obligation to do an excellent job of teaching and mentoring and their willingness to put in the time and necessary enthusiasm towards learning. It is also my belief that if students know about their own history of accomplishments in science then their individual contributions have a much higher probability of occurring.
