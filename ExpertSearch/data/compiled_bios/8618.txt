Chen Home Publications Research Teaching Projects CV Menu Annie T. Chen I am an associate professor in the Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education, at the University of Washington School of Medicine. My research interests include: information behaviors in the context of chronic conditions, health-related social media use, and research methods. Some of the topics I am particularly interested in include long-term health knowledge acquisition and formation, and how patients conceptualizations of wellness may change over time. My vision is that knowledge about these types of processes can be used in the design of intuitive search interfaces for patients, as well as analytical tools that serve as lenses for understanding patient experience.
