Sodini received his BS degree in Electrical Engineering from Purdue University, in 1974, and his MS and PhD degrees in the same from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1981 and 1982, respectively.He was a member of the technical staff at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories from 1974 to 1982, where he worked on the design of MOS memory. He joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in 1983, where he is currently the LeBel Professor of Electrical Engineering. His research interests are focused on medical electronic systems for monitoring and imaging. These systems require state-of-the-art mixed signal integrated circuit and systems with extremely low energy dissipation. Along with Professor Roger T. Howe, Dr.Sodini is a co-author of an undergraduate text on integrated circuits and devices entitled Microelectronics: An Integrated Approach. He also studied the Hong Kong/South China electronics industry in 1996-97 and has continued to study the globalization of the electronics industry. Dr. Sodini was a co-founder of SMaL Camera Technologies and has served on a variety of IEEE Conference Committees, including IEDM where he was the 1989 General Chairman. He has served on the IEEE Electron Device Society Administrative Committee and was president of the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society from 2002-2004.He serves on a variety of industry boards and is a Fellow of the IEEE. Most recently, Dr. Sodini founded and leads the Medical Electronic Device Realization Center (MEDRC); which works to establish a partnership among the microelectronics industry, the medical devices industry, medical professionals, and MIT. Working together, MEDRC seeks improvements in the cost and performance of medical electronic devices similar to those that have occurred in personal computers, communication devices and consumer electronics using advanced technology with wireless sensors. degrees PhD in Electrical Engineering, University of California at Berkeley, 1982 MS inElectrical Engineering, University of California at Berkeley, 1981 BS inElectrical Engineering, Purdu, 1974 research Professor Sodinis principal fields of interest are electronics and integrated circuit design and technology. More specifically, his research concerns technology intensive integrated circuit and systems design, with application toward sensory interface electronics and wireless communication emphasizing analog signal processing and RF integrated circuits. Professor Sodinis group is exploring novel integrated technology, device physics, and circuit design, and its application to specific microsystems including medical electronic systems for monitoring and imaging. The requirements of the systems dictate the areas in which innovation must take place. This approach allows students to understand and play a role in the big picture while simultaneously concentrating on specific innovation in a tightly focused project. The program is a fertile ground for students to learn and appreciate the importance of breadth across many disciplines for systems optimization as well as depth in their particular project. These students will be prepared for the broad challenges that microelectronic technology will face in the 21st century. selected publications Y. Lai, G. Saavedra-Pea, C.G. Sodini, T. Heldt, and V.
