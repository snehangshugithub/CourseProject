At these temperatures, atoms can be made to mimic interesting quantum systems from condensed matter, nuclear, and high-energy particle physics. We can also use light to drive chemical reactions that form molecules at similarly low temperatures. These ultracold molecules are a great resource for studying quantum chemistry and quantum information.

Quantum many-body physics embraces attempts to build quantum computers, understand exotic new materials, and fundamental questions such as measurement and thermalization in quantum mechanics. Ultracold atoms and molecules provide pristine systems in which to study quantum many-body physics, free from the defects and impurities of bulk materials and completely isolated from the outside world. We use the exquisite control available in ultracold systems to tackle some of the deepest questions of how our universe is put together and how it evolves with time.
