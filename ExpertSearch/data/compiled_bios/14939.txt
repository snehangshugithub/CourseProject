Our main tools are single-channel and ensemble electrophysiology, and protein-engineering techniques. Some of the particular issues we have been working on lately are: Quantitative characterization of fundamental properties of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels such as rate and equilibrium constants of ligand binding in the closed and open states. Quantitative understanding of the different phenomena that contribute to the kinetics of the postsynaptic current decay under physiological and pathological conditions. Linear free-energy relationships and the chemical dynamics of the closed-to-open conformational change. Relationship between structure and electrostatics of the pore domain.
