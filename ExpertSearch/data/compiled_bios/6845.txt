Reidenbach Bio Ph.D. Stanford University, Civil and Environmental Engineering 2004M.S. Stanford University, Civil and Environmental Engineering 1998B.S. Cornell University, Civil and Environmental Engineering 1997 Reidenbach's primary area of research is environmental fluid dynamics, with an emphasis on physical-biological interactions in coastal environments. Current research activities include the effects of flow and turbulence on nutrient exchange in coral reefs, sediment transport in estuaries, chemical dispersion in the coastal ocean, and wave dynamics. His research also investigates coastal resilience and exploring ecosystems such as coral reefs, seagrasses and oyster beds, both alter and respond to wave and storm impacts along coastlines. This has important implications to economic losses and the vulnerability of coastal communities to storms, flooding, and sea level rise.
