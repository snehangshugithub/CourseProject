He has consulted on and designed structural monitoring systems for bridges around the world, including New Yorks Brooklyn Bridge; Lingotto Bridge in Turin, Italy; New Yorks Manhattan Bridge; several cable-stayed bridges in China; and numerous other bridges in the United States including the I-5 Lambert Road box girder bridge in Sacramento, California, as well as Kishwaukee Bridge and Thornton Quarry Bridges in Illinois. Professor Ansari and his students perform fundamental research in structural engineering, sensor technologies, nondestructive testing and mechanics. A major portion of his work involves forensic investigations of bridges and other types of structures. His recent work in Italy pertained to the post collapse analysis of the Morandi Polcevera viaduct in Genoa, Italy. Editorship Editor-in-Chief, Journal of Civil Structural Health Monitoring, JCSHM, Published by Springer Research Laboratory Our expertise is in structural health monitoring of civil infrastructure systems. We develop strategies for forensic analysis of bridges, buildings and other types of civil infrastructure facilities such as pipelines, and tunnels. Our capabilities are unique since we are structural engineers with expertise in fiber optic sensors. Depending on the application, we may either use discrete (FBG) or distributed sensors (BOTDA, Rayleigh, MZ, etc). The range of our structural health monitoring activities include design of the sensor system and wiring for the structure and problem to be solved; installation of the sensor system in the structure; installation of the interrogation unit and data acquisition system in the field; installation of the software specific for the parameters to be monitored; remote real time monitoring of the sensor data; analysis and recommendations. Examples of our projects can be found in our laboratory site. As an academic entity, the most important product of our laboratory is our students, post doctoral fellows and visiting scholars. Our students will all develop unique expertise in sensors, NDT, and structural health monitoring by the time of their graduation.
