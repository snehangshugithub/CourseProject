She has a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University and a broad technical background in experimental solid-state physics and fabrication of optical components. In 1991, she received the Maria Goeppert-Mayer Award of the American Physical Society for her work on compound formation using ion implantation. She was named a Bell Labs Fellow in 2001 for her work in developing and applying novel integrated photonic device technologies in advanced optical networks. With over 125 publications and 7 patents issued/pending, she is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, the IEEE Photonics Society, and the Optical Society of America. At BU, she leads a department with 51 faculty members. In 2014, she established the Multiscale Laser Lithography Lab and is developing mechanical metamaterials for biological studies using a laser direct write technology. This research is one thrust of a recently established BU-led NSF Engineering Research Center (ERC), CELL-MET. In addition to her role in Mechanical Engineering, she is a Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, a Professor of Biomedical Engineering, and a Professor of Physics, as well as an affiliate of the BU Photonics Center and BU Nano.
