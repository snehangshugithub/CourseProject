Shull Fellow, Oak Ridge National Laboratory Research Statement YZs research can be summarized into two words: Matter and Machine. On the Matter side, his group synergistically combines and pushes the boundaries of accelerated atomistic simulations, stochastic dynamics theories, and neutron scattering experiments, with the goal of significantly extending our understanding of a wide range of long timescale phenomena, rare events, and far-from-equilibrium properties of materials from the atomic and molecular level. Particular emphasis is given to the physics and chemistry of liquids and complex fluids, especially at interfaces, driven away from equilibrium, or under extreme conditions. On the Machine side, leveraging their expertise in materials and modeling, his group advances the development of soft robots and human-compatible machines, robots in extreme environments, and understandable artificial intelligence and intelligent control, which can lead to immediate societal impact. The common theme between these two research thrusts is complexity and emergence, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Research Interests Matter: Far-from-equilibrium physics, accelerated atomistic simulations, and stochastic dynamics (long timescale phenomena, rare events); Physics and chemistry of liquids and complex fluids, especially under interfacial/non-equilibrium/extreme conditions (water, metallic liquids, molten salts, ionic liquids, electrolyte solutions); Neutron scattering, sources, and instrumentation Machine: Soft robots and human-compatible machines; Robots in extreme environments; Understandable artificial intelligence and intelligent control Research Areas Atomistic simulations Computational Multi-Fluid Dynamics Ion bombardment Liquids and glassy materials MD and kMC Neutron and X-ray scattering Nuclear Materials Soft and biological materials Selected Articles in Journals http://z.engineering.illinois.edu/publications.html Journal Editorships Associate Editor, Science and Technology of Advanced Materials, IF=8.090 (2020), 2016 - present Honors Donald Biggar Willett Faculty Scholar, UIUC (2020) Dean's Award for Excellence in Research, Grainger College of Engineering, UIUC (2020) Landis Young Member Engineering Achievement Award, American Nuclear Society, "in recognition of his contributions to nuclear and advanced experimental techniques to understand the complex makeup, nature and performance of materials in the far-from-equilibrium state" (2017) Doctoral New Investigator Award, American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund (2015) Collins Fellow, UIUC (2013) List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent (Fall 2013, Fall 2014, Spring 2015, Spring 2017, Fall 2017, Spring 2018, Fall 2018, Spring 2019) (2013-present) Clifford G.
