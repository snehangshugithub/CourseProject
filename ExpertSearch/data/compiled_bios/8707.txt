The tape could eventually replace surgical sutures, which dont work well in all tissues and can cause complications in some patients. WATCH VIDEO Inflatable robotic hand gives amputees real-time tactile control Professor Xuanhe Zhao has developed an inflatable robotic hand. The low-cost soft prosthetic hand could be used by low-income families who have suffered from amputation.
