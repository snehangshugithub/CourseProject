In her empirical research, she identifies which goals might be particularly associated with unintended effects in consumer contexts. Her theoretical work argues that an individual's expressed judgments and behaviors can be understood as indirectly controlled by multiple conscious and unconscious goals. Dr. Huang has published this research in behavioral science journals, including Behavioral and Brain Sciences, Psychological Science, and The Journal of Experimental Social Psychology.
