His research addresses sustainable manufacturing challenges, including life cycle engineering methods, manufacturing process performance modeling, and engineering education. His work has appeared in more than 100 peer-reviewed chapters, proceedings, and journal articles. He has participated in over $10M in research from the Army, DOE, NIST, NSF, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Oregon BEST, the Oregon Metals Initiative, and industry, including Boeing, Benchmade, Blount, Caterpillar, HP Inc., Master Chemical, PGE, and Sheldon Manufacturing. He serves as Assistant Director of OSU's DOE Industrial Assessment Center and leads northwestern activities of the CESMII Western Regional Manufacturing Center. He has served in volunteer leader positions within ASME (including 2020 MSEC Technical Program Co-chair) and SME (including 2020 Student Relations Committee Chair), and has been inducted into the honor societies of Pi Tau Sigma, Phi Kappa Phi, and Sigma Xi. He has been recognized by the NAE (2015 Frontiers of Engineering) and SME (2014 Outstanding Young Manufacturing Engineer Award and 2012 & 2015 Distinguished Faculty Advisor Awards) and received Best Paper Awards from ASME (2015 & 2016 DFMLC), CIRP (2012 LCE), and ISSS (2017). He received a Fulbright-Tampere University Faculty Scholar Award for the 2019-2020 academic year to conduct research and teaching at the intersection of smart and sustainable manufacturing as applied to additive manufacturing processes. He completed his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering and his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering-Engineering Mechanics, as an NSF IGERT trainee (2004-2008), from Michigan Technological University.
