Serving more than 3,800 students and 50,000 alumni, under Kens leadership the Questrom School of Business pursued the vision of Creating Value for the World. The School transformed its undergraduate and MBA curricula, with a focus on ethics and global citizenship, and sectors that are dramatically impacting the world economy health and life sciences, digital technology, sustainability and social enterprise.
