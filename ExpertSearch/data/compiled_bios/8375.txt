Through spectroscopy we can learn about the distances, ages, chemical composition and star formation histories of these galaxies.As the light we observe from more distant objects originated at earlier times, by observing ever more distant systems we can reconstruct the changes that occur over time to populations of galaxies. Hisparticular expertise lies in trying to understand the source of the puzzling link between galaxy growth rates and surrounding large-scale structure, many orders of magnitude larger than the galaxies themselves.

This structure is the foundation on which galaxies form and evolve; but the growth of galaxies is a much more complex process that involves exchanges of vast amount of energies over large spatial and time scales.Professor Balogh uses the the world's largest telescopes to measure how the mass, age and chemical composition of galaxies changes with time, and how that relates to the surrounding large scale dark matter structure. This requires careful photometric and spectroscopic measurements at optical and near-infrared wavelengths; interpreting the data requires both the development of toy models to identify the driving parameters, as well as detailed comparison with numerical simulations to understand the interplay between competing physical processes.
