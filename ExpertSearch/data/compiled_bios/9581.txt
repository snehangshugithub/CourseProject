Prior to this, he obtained a BA in Economics and BS in Mathematics from Brigham Young University and a PhD in Economics from MIT, and spent one year as postdoctoral researcher at eBay Research. He is also a Faculty Research Fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research and a Faculty Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. He is currently a W. Glenn Campbell and Rita Ricardo-Campbell National Fellow at the Hoover Institution. His primary area of research is Industrial Organization, with specific emphasis on bargaining and occupational licensing. His recent research projects study large datasets of alternating-offer-negotiation settings to analyze behavioral patterns and efficiency in bargaining. He also studies the effects of occupational licensing regulations on market outcomes such as prices, competition, and the distribution of service quality. Other recent projects study auctions, consumer search, digital copyright law and grey-market activity, changes in US wage inequality due to increased import competition with China, the effects of laws legitimizing arbitrage (parallel importation) across international markets, and applied econometric methods.
