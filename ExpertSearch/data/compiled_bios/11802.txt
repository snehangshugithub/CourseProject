He worked at AT&T Bell Laboratories from 1979 to 1982 and has been with the University of Hawaii since 1986. He is currently a Professor of Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Hawaii . From 1999 to 2002 he served as Chair of the Electrical Engineering Department . He also helped to form the Hawaii Center for Advanced Communications (HCAC) and served as interim director from 2000 to 2001. During the 2003-2004 academic year he was a visiting faculty member at Imperial College, London where he received a distinguished Fulbright scholar's award Dr. Kuh's research interests are in the areas of machine learning and neural networks, adaptive signal processing, sensor networks, and communication networks. Dr. Kuh was a recipient of the NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award in 1988. He was elected Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 1998 for his contributions to analysis of neural network models and their applications to signal processing. He has been an associate editor for IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems, from 1990 - 1991, 1995 -1997, 2002-2004, and 2005-2007. From 1990-1995 he served on the IEEE Neural Network Council Administrative Committee representing the Information Theory Society. He served as a member of the Neural Networks for Signal Processing Committee in the IEEE Signal Processing Society from 1998 - 2001. He also co-chaired the 1993 International Symposium on Nonlinear Theory and Its Applications held in Honolulu . He has served as local arrangements chair for the 1997 NOLTA Symposium, 1999 NOLTA Symposium, 2000 ISPACS Symposium, and the 2002 World Congress on Computational Intelligence all held in Hawaii . He is also serving as the technical co-chair for the 2007 ICASSP to be held in Honolulu . His research interests are in machine learning (learning theory, kernel machines, reinforcement learning), adaptive signal processing, and sensor networks.
