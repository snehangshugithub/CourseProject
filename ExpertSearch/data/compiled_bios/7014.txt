We use human and mammalian cell lines to investigate the impact of microtubule motors and regulators of microtubule polymerization on the fidelity of cell division and chromosome instability. We use high resolution and super-resolution live cell imaging and total internal fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy in conjunction with fluorescent proteins, bio-sensors and gene-edited cell lines to investigate dynamic processes that govern chromosome segregation during mitosis.
