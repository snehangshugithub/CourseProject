Some areas of special interest include:Tools for detecting natural selection in microbesThe evolutionary origin of gene familiesMining metagenomic sequence dataExperimental evolution of microbesModeling bacterial ecologyGene regulatory networks in bacteriaProtein structure and designTeaching InterestsI have enjoyed teaching a variety of classes at MIT, spanning my own diverse interests in microbiology, computer algorithms, and thermodynamics of biomolecules. I am currently looking forward to teaching a new class on microbial evolution and genetics.Selected PublicationsShapiro B.J. and Alm E.J.
