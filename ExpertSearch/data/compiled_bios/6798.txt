The understanding and exploration of how relativisitcs particles radiate and interact with the radiation has led to the remarkable growth of accelerator-based x-ray light sources that yield atomic spatical resolution and femtosecond temporal resolution of matter. A primer example is the world's first hard x-ray free-electron laser, the linac coherent light source (LCLS) at SLAC. My work centers on the research and development of the LCLS, the LCLS-II and future light sources.
