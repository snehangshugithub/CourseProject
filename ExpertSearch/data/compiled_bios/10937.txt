My research involves high energy physics, with a primary focus on searches for new particles and interactions with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which straddles the French-Swiss border. I contribute to silicon tracker operations at CMS and detector development for next-generation experiments such as those planned for HL-LHC. My group includes faculty colleagues in particle theory and experiment, as well as my postdocs, grad students, undergrads, and technicians.
