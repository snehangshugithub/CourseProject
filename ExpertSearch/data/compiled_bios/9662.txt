The specifics of damage detection methods to embed into structural design include the control of elastic wave propagation released by defects with acoustic metamaterials, sub-wavelength imaging with nonlinear ultrasonics and phononic crystals, MEMS sensors for light-weight structural health monitoring systems, and real-time algorithm development with multi-sensor and machine learning. The infrastructure and manufacturing examples include underground structures, bridges and welding. My primary teaching interests are structural analysis and design including steel structures and pre-stressed concrete structures, structural dynamics and nondestructive evaluation. I introduce innovation in structural design in undergraduate courses, and bring research outcomes as a part of course content. I believe in continuing education to tackle the challenging infrastructure problems and adapt the technological advancement in data and manufacturing into Civil Engineering curriculum.
