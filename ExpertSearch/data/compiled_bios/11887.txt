(En-Passant) & Ph.D. University of IowaB.E. Southwest Jiaotong University Research Interests: Mechanics of composite materials under extreme environmentsMultifunctional composite materialsDurability and damage tolerance of composite structuresMultiphysics modeling Current Research: Dr. Wangs current research goal is twofold: 1) to understand the material behavior and failure mechanisms of composite materials and structures under extreme environments (lightning strike, laser, aerodynamic heating, and mechanical impact) through multiphysics modeling and experimental validation and 2) to improve the survivability, durability, and damage tolerance of composite structures under extreme environments through the design and development of multifunctional composite materials, including nanostructured and bio-inspired composite materials.
