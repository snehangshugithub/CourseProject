The applications include word processing, spreadsheet, and database management. Students will also learn computer terms and concepts as well as the historical, social and economic implications of computer technology for our society.Course Syllabus3 CRS.2 HRS.3 LAB HRS.CIS 395CIS 395 (Database Systems I)This course introduces the design, implementation, testing, and manipulation of database management systems. The design techniques include conceptual data modeling, entity relational modeling and normalization techniques. The databases are then implemented using structured query languages. Testing strategies verify data integrity, security, and privacy. Manipulation activities include insert, update, and delete operations. Prerequisite: CSC 110 or CSC 111 or department approval.Course Syllabus3 CRS.4 HRS.CIS 440CIS 440 (UNIX)Students are introduced to the UNIX operating system, its external commands, internal structures, and text processing capabilities.Prerequisite: CSC 110 or CSC 111 or CIS 255 or Departmental PermissionCourse Syllabus3 CRS.2 HRS.2 LAB HRS.CSC 101CSC 101 (Principles in Information Technology and Computation)This course introduces the student to the principles and theories of computation and information processing. The topics include hardware and software organization, data representation, algorithm development and networking principles. Special emphasis will be placed on creation of knowledge from data; the impact of computation on daily life; role of abstraction in solving problems; and implementation of algorithms on a variety of platforms including the Internet.4 CRS.3 HRS.2 LAB HRS.CSC 111CSC 111 (Introduction to Programming)This course is an introduction to the fundamental concepts and terms of computer science, including algorithms, problem solving techniques, data types, concept of loops, conditional statements, modular programming, pointers, arrays, strings, basic file processing, structures and simple classes. Students will use a high-level computer programming language to solve a variety of problems. Prerequisite: MAT 206 and [CSC 101 or departmental approval]3 CRS.2 HRS.3 LAB HRS.CSC 211CSC 211 (Advanced Programming Techniques)This is a second course in programming which will further develop those skills gained in CSC 111 emphasizing reliability, maintainability, and reusability. Students will be introduced to applications of Pointers, Dynamic memory allocation, Arrays, Abstract data types, Objects, classes, and object-oriented design. Additional programming topics such as Inheritance, Polymorphism, Text Processing, Exception Handling, Recursion and Templates will also be covered. Prerequisite: CSC 111 or departmental approval2 CRS.15 HRS.GIS 325GIS 325 (GIS Internship)The objective of the internship is to allow the student to put classroom theory in /major into the practice in order to gain work experience. Each student-intern will work 15 hours a week for the length of the semester. Each student-intern is assigned to an internship professor who is knowledgeable about the student's field. The internship professor helps the student secure internship placement in a work site related to the student's major, or assists the student to "reconstruct" her/his present position as an internship, or develop - by special arrangement and an internship with her/his present employer, and serves as the student's instructor and advisor during the field experience. Student interns are expected to work 15 hours a week, complete a term project assigned by the internship professor, and be evaluated by the work site supervisor. Students to be placed are expected to arrange their schedules so that they are free mornings, or afternoons, Monday-Friday, or two to three full days per week. Prerequisite: Completion of all remedial requirements; GPA of 3.0 in major courses; demonstrated excellence in oral and written communication (B or better in ENG 201 and SPE 100/102 or permission of the instructor); completion of CED 201; completion of at least 36 credits including prerequisites for GIS students and CIS 395, GIS 261, MAT 209.Research and ProjectsPublicationsHonors, Awards and AffiliationsAdditional Information Borough of Manhattan Community College The City University of New York 199 Chambers Street New York, NY 10007 Directions (212) 220-8000 Directory Notice of Non-Discrimination News Event Calendar Job Opportunities Human Resources Admissions Library Give to BMCC Accessibility Virtual Tour Academic Policies Privacy Policy Text-only Version Information for: Students Faculty & Staff Alumni Social Media Directory
