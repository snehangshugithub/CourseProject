Regional anesthesia and pain medicine, vol. 24, no. 3, 1999, pp. 208-13. PubMed Research Research Overview Pain is a protective mechanism but chronic pain can be life-threatening. My research is focused on studying brain connectivity under pain conditions. My lab uses electrophysiology, behavior and signal analysis to identify pain biomarkers, and to test neuromodulation technologies to manage chronic pain diseases. Research Statement Pain is a national health problem with over $150 billion/year in direct costs and lost productivity. To date, the gold standard for the diagnosis of chronic pain is subjective, verbal report by the patient. My long-term goal is to identify an objective neural signature that could be used as a pain diagnostic, which will also help us better evaluate new therapeutics, as well as better understand the mechanisms of sensory and pain transmission in the brain. Such improvement would also be used to guide neuromodulation techniques for more effective management of chronic pain. Funded Research (Completed) 1.
