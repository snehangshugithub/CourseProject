Professor Yu is primarily interested in materials development for energy storage and conversion, photocatylsts, and nano composites. She is an expert in carbon nanotubes and graphene, allowing her to design the proper porosity and polarity of nanomaterials for high energy storage supercapacitors and ultra-strong nanocomposites. Her previous work in the plastics and carbon solutions industries has led her to dedicate her research toward developing nanomaterials for practical applications. Professor Yus Applied Carbon Nanotechnology Laboratory research group is interested in applying carbon nano-tubes and graphene to a variety of metal oxides and conducting polymers for super-capacitors. In addition, the group studies energy storage mechanisms for new hybrid energy systems. Professor Yu holds 4 granted and applied patents and has published over 40 papers in peer-reviewed journals that include A to Z of Nanotechnology. She is also the co-author of Electrochemical Supercapacitors for Energy Storage and Delivery: Fundamentals and Applications for CRC, as well as the editor-in-chief of the journal Supercapacitor.Research InterestsNanomaterials synthesis and processingFunctionalization of carbon nanotube and grapheneNanomaterials for engineering nanocompositesNanomaterials for supercapacitorNanomaterials for sensor/actuatorNanomaterials for solar cellWaterNanotechnologyEducation2008, Doctorate, Chemical & Environmental Engineering, University of California, Riverside2002, Master of Engineering, Chemical Engineering, East China University of Science and TechnologyCourses*CHE 241 - Materials Science and EngTaught in 2016, 2017, 2019CHE 755 - Res Tpcs in Electrochem.
