More specifically, he uses methods of applied math, theoretical biophysics, and system biology to understand how cells move and how they divide. In the past few years, Alex focused on modeling mitotic spindle assembly and keratocyte cell migration. Selected publications B. Rubinstein, M.F. Fournier, K. Jacobson, A. Verkhovsky, A. Mogilner.
