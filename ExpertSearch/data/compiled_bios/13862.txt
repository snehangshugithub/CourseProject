Gunawi is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago where he leads the UCARE research group (UChicago systems research on Availability, Reliability, and Efficiency). He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 2009. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley from 2010 to 2012. His current research focuses on cloud computing reliability and new storage technology.He has won numerous awards including NSF CAREER award, NSF Computing Innovation Fellowship, Google Faculty Research Award, NetApp Faculty Fellowships, and Honorable Mention for the 2009 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award. His research focus is in improving dependability of storage and cloud computing systems in the context of (1) performance stability, wherein he is interested in building storage and distributed systems that are robust to latency tails and "limping" hardware, and (2) reliability and scalability, wherein he is interested in combating concurrency and scalability bugs in cloud-scale distributed systems, and (3) interactions of machine learning and systems, specifically how machine learning techniques can address operating/storage system problems.
