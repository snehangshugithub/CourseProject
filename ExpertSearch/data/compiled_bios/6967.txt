Born in France, I was raised in a bilingual household in the countryside and traveled to the US. I attended a small liberal arts school in Florida (Eckerd College) the moved to Boston for my Master's Degree in Biology from Tufts University and later attended Emory University, in Georgia for my Ph.D. in Immunology and Molecular Pathogenesis. My thesis research was based on incompatible transfusions of red blood cells and have yielded more questions than answers! I later joined the Immunization and Respiratory Diseases branch of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to study the immune reactions to influenza and vaccines in mice and humans. In light of my interest for teaching, learning and research, I became an NIH IRACDA fellow which trained us in teaching at HBCUs along side our research. I consider myself an educator and an immunologist with a specialty in virology and red blood cell immunology. I have taught classes since 2008 and aim to form communities within my classrooms. Outreach opportunities and igniting projects are always of interest. As an example, two Freshmen students used crowd sourcing to designed a detection method to help screenings during the 2014 Ebola outbreak and submitted an application to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Think of ways you could start a project!
