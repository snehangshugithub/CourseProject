Alexander L (Sasha) Klibanov, Associate Professor Born and raised and educated (all the way past Ph.D.) in Moscow, then USSR, what is now Russia. In 1991 moved to USA and worked in academic research and industrial positions. Research interests are in the area of chemistry applications in biomedical research. Ultrasound imaging is a widespread and inexpensive non-invasive diagnostic technique. Ultrasound contrast agents offer a flexible platform that can be used for diagnostic imaging as a blood pool marker (tissue perfusion), as a targeted marker for imaging of inflammation, angiogenesis, and also as adjunct microdevices for enhanced targeted drug delivery and gene therapy. In diagnostic imaging, detection of contrast material offers high sensitivity (individual micron-sized particles can be visualized in vitro and in vivo by ultrasound medical imaging systems). We prepare and analyze such ultrasound contrast materials, attach targeting ligands (antibodies, peptides) and plasmid DNA to their surface for targeting and ultrasound-enhanced delivery. Using colloid chemistry-based approaches, stable microbubbles with extended circulation lifetime are designed; polymer brush coating is applied to ensure enhanced stability.
