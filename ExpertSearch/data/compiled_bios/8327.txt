The software uses extensive computational algorithms that automatically recognize geometric and design features and translate them into manufacturing features. Plug-in modules allow engineers to use feature-based costing for all major manufacturing processes.He also conducts research in the areas of micro-miniature systems, design for manufacture and assembly, rapid prototyping and layered manufacturing, computer integrated manufacture (CIM), and robotics and automation. With MechSE colleague Mark Shannon, Professor Philpott developed a Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) research program that grew into developing new types of micro- and mesoscale heat pumps. The research led to a program funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to design and prototype for manufacture an Integrated Mesoscopic Cooler Circuit (IMCC), an extremely lightweight, thin, flexible and fully self-contained heat pump to provide cooling and heating in clothing. Two patents have been issued for the IMCC to date, and for the flexible microchannel heat exchangers, including the design for manufacture.Professor Philpott was also involved in the development of a new type of mesoscale thermomechanical (MTM) water purification system. He brought rapid prototyping, computer-aided design and systems integration together to develop a three-dimensional fluid system incorporating ice, water and filters to be used in desalinating water. From this work emerged a new NSF Science and Technology Center focused on developing new technologies for purifying water.
