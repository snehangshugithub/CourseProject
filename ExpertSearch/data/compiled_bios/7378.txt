Research Interests My current research interests are in applied mathematics for climate atmosphere ocean science. I am currently working on methods for spatiotemporal decomposition of large-scale data from climate models and observations combining ideas from machine learning and dynamical systems theory. This work has applications in the detection and forecasting of climate patterns on seasonal to interannual timescales. In the past I have worked on spectral methods for free-surface magnetohydrodynamics. Selected Publications D. Giannakis and A.J.
