Dr. Ezzeldin completed his Ph.D. at McMaster University, and both his M.Sc. and B.Sc. at Ain Shams University in Cairo, Egypt. Dr. Ezzeldins research focuses on two main areas. The first area deals with quantifying the system-level performance of structures under extreme events induced by natural or anthropogenic hazards. The second area focuses on simulating the complex interdependence within large civil infrastructure systems to enhance their overall resilience. He is interested in testing systems and integrating the resulting performance data with numerical simulation and analytical modeling approaches to develop system-level risk assessment and resilience quantification tools. His research in such two areas also capitalizes on different emerging technologies such as data mining, machine learning and other artificial intelligence techniques to develop system performance predictive models.
