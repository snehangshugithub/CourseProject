Prospective PhD students & academic visitors interested in Autonomous Systems and Robotics, AI, Medical Robotics, Bio-Manufacturing, Sensors, and Smart IoT devices are encouraged to contact me by email with your full CV. I joined Essex in April 2020 as a UK lecturer in School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, CSEE at University of Essex (UoE), UK. Prior to this position, I was a lecturer/senior lecturer at Teesside University and University of Wolverhampton respectively. I received my Ph.D. degree from Kings College London (top 20 world university), U.K. And then I took postdoctoral positions at Durham University, Newcastle University, Brunel University London (U.K.), and TWI. I am a Fellow of HE and a member of IEEE and IET. My research is focused on AI especially neural networks, medical robotics and smart devices, bespoke robotic solutions for industries and laboratories in life science, energy and agri-food areas. I have been working on projects from EU, EPSRC, and Innovate UK on DNA extraction robotics, biomass sample handing robotics, and Li-ion battery measurement and modeling most recently. I have published over 30 research articles in peer-reviewed journals such as IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, and IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, etc. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I have led (PI/CoI) or participated as PDRA a number of projects worth about 27 Millions. 01/201903/2020 Project: Intelligent Flexible Ultrasonic Sensing Technologies for Battery Health and Life Monitoring (GBP 9K) 06/201812/2018 Project: Novel Ultrasonic Techniques for Medical Application (GBP 6K), Sponsor: European Regional Development Fund, University of Wolverhampton 06/201812/2018 Project: Modeling ultrasonic probes-connective tissue interaction on a phantom foot model using advanced finite element method and vibration analysis towards better shockwave therapy of plantar fasciitis (GBP 5K) Sponsor: Early Researcher Awarded Scheme, University of Wolverhampton GBP 5K. 09/201703/2018 Project: Autonomous, robotic and AI-enabled biofouling monitoring, cleaning, and management System for offshore wind turbine monopile foundations.
