Our studies focus on the Zic family of zinc-finger transcription factors and on their roles in the developing forebrain, neural retina and midbrain (future optic tectum). In humans, mutations in Zic genes are a significant cause of holoprosencephaly, a devastating birth defect that affects the cerebral cortex and other tissues. To understand how Zic genes participate in shaping the vertebrate brain and retina, we use a model organism, the zebrafish Danio rerio. Zebrafish embryos are accessible at all stages of development and are amenable to a variety of powerful experimental methods, including forward and reverse genetics, micromanipulation and high-resolution live imaging. Using these methods, we have demonstrated novel roles for Zic genes in regulating cell shape changes and cell cycle progression in the brain primordium, and in patterning and morphogenesis of the neural retina. Using Zic genes as an entry point, we are working to elucidate the gene networks and cellular interactions that drive these important morphogenetic processes. Figure(right): Retinal morphogenesis is disrupted after Zic2a expression is experimentally depleted or expanded, resulting in ventral retinal defects and coloboma.
