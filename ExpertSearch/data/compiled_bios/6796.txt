Fetter Faculty Emeritus Professor of Physics and Applied Physics Sites Stanford ProfileDescription of Interests: Condensed Matter Physics My work over the past decade has focused on the behavior of ultra-cold dilute quantum gases. This rapidly evolving area has spanned the fields of atomic physics and condensed matter physics, borrowing from both, with many spectacular new results. I am especially interested in the response to external rotations, which involve quantized vortices.
