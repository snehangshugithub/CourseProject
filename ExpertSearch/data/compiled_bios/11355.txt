Chemistry and Mathematics, Kenyatta University, Nairobi, Kenya Ph.D. Analytical Chemistry, State University of New York (SUNY) at Binghamton NY Postdoctoral Research Associate, Research Foundation of SUNY, Binghamton, NY 2007 2009 Postdoctoral Fellow, Syracuse University, Syracuse NY, 2010 2012 Research Interests Nanoscience, Materials chemistry, Catalysis, Renewable Energy, Electrochemistry and Nano-Forensic Chemistry The main focus of our research interests is in nanoscience, materials chemistry, catalysis, renewable energy, electrochemistry and application of nanotechnology in forensic chemistry. Current projects involve synthesis and characterization of monometallic and alloyed nanoparticles based on gold, silver, platinum and copper. These nanoparticles have applications in catalysis, fuel cells, drug delivery, and forensic detections. Future works will focus on (i) extending the applications of these nanomaterials to fuel cell based breathalyzers, detection of latent finger prints, and trace evidence analysis; and (ii) studying the toxicity of silver nanoparticles resulting from the vast applications in many consumers' products.
