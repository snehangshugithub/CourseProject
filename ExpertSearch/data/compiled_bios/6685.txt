Rubin Professor in Medical Engineering and Science Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science bio Dr. Collin M. Stultz is a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a faculty member in the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, a Professor in the Institute of Medical Engineering and Sciences at MIT, a member of the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE), and an associate member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). He is also a practicing cardiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Dr. Stultz received his undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Philosophy from Harvard University; a PhD in Biophysics from Harvard University; and a MD from Harvard Medical School. He did his internship, residency, and fellowship at the Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston. His scientific contributions have spanned multiple fields including computational chemistry, biophysics, and machine learning for cardiovascular risk stratification. He is a member of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology and he is a past recipient of a National Science Foundation CAREER Award and a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award in the Biomedical Sciences. Currently, research in his group is focused on the development of machine learning tools that can guide clinical decision making. degrees PhD in Biophysics, Harvard University, 1997 MD, Harvard Medical School, 1997 AB, Harvard College, 1988 selected awards/societies Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award in Biomedical Sciences James Tolbert Shipley Prize American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology American Chemical Society research Research in the Computational Cardiovascular Research Group is focused on three areas: 1) Understanding conformational changes in biomolecules that play an important role in common human diseases, 2) Using machine learning to develop models that identify patients at high risk of adverse clinical events, and 3) Developing new methods to discover optimal treatment strategies for high risk patients. The group uses an interdisciplinary approach combining computational modeling and machine learning to accomplish these tasks. selected publications Myers PD., Scirica BM., Stultz Cm., Machine Learning Improves Risk Stratification After Acute Coronary Syndrome.
