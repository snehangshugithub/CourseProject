Biological interfaces, ranging from cells to the human sense of touch, are complex because they are softand patterned. Although they are complex, controlling these biological interfaces are important in a rangeof applications, including basic biology, cancer detection, and virtual reality for the sense of touch. Toachieve these goals, we build devices, perform simulations and modeling, and incorporate new materialsincluding conductive polymers and graphene sensors. Research Interests Quantifying and Designing for the Sense of Touch We seek to build devices that can convincingly recreate the human sense of touch. To achieve this goal,we are investigating the basic mechanical forces that generate tactile sensations. By identifying andquantifying these mechanical forces, we can identify materials and design devices that recreate arbitrarytactile sensations. These insights are important for many fields, from basic biology, remote surgery,training in virtual reality, to entertainment. Mechanical Properties of Single Cells and Thin Tissues The mechanical properties of cells and tissues are important biomarkers for diagnosing diseases andstudying basic biology. However, directly measuring the mechanical properties of cells and tissues isdifficult, especially with live cells and in a high-throughput manner. We develop platforms that canmeasure these properties in a convenient method that is orthogonal to many existing techniques. Mechanical Forces in Complex Geometries and Deformable Interfaces In nature, most systems are comprised of heterogenous and complex shapes, whereas most man-madeobjects are relatively simple and smooth. Although these systems in nature are more complex, theenhanced function of natural systems is often derived from these irregular shapes and deformableinterfaces. We seek to recreate these complex geometries and provide experimental evidence to explain avariety of mechanical phenomena.
