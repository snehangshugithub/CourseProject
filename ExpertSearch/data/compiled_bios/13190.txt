They represent a class of technologically important problems for which the connection between microscale studies and macroscale behavior remains poorly understood. Emerging concepts based on energy landscape modeling, coarse graining by transition state theory, and biased sampling of reaction pathways are making it possible to probe the mechanisms controlling macro-scale deformation and flow observed in experiments. We are particularly interested in the time- and stress-dependent manifestations of avalanche, intermittency, and localization behavior in systems far from equilibrium, and regard them as problems defining the frontiers of mesoscale modeling and simulation.
