Parsons, Associate Teaching Professor Erika F. Parsons, Ph.D. Associate Teaching Professor Dr. Parsons received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, working with the Innovative Computing Laboratory. At Microsoft (2008-2013), she worked as an SDET for the Developer Division (.NET Framework). After rediscovering her passion for teaching and academic work, she became faculty at Washington State University and Everett Community College in 2013, prior to joining UW Bothell. At Microsoft, Dr. Parsons worked in software reliability and performance testing for quality assurance across features of the Common Language Runtime, and designed technical specifications for threading features of the product. In regards to teaching, her philosophy and goal is to prepare students to be independent and motivated learners, focused around being a team with the students, where everybody has responsibilities towards a goal, very much like in industry. Dr. Parsons research work and interests have focused on high performance computing, applied machine learning and statistical data analysis. Her research efforts have recently geared towards the application machine learning algorithms for development of software tools for academic advising, in particular a recommendation system for student academic pathways.
