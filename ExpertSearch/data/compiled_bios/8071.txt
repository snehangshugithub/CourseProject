We pursue the development of novel technologies for user-based applications of high socio-economic relevance and technologies with unique abilities that facilitate scientific advances in chemistry, biology and medicine. We approach technology development through the study of fundamental problems at the micro- and nanoscale, computational modelling and experimentation. Our research is inherently multidisciplinary and is particularly applicable to label-free sensing requiring real-time measurements in situ.

CHEE 912 Applied Lab-on-Chip Technologies This 6 week (3 hours/week) module will provide an overview on the latest developments, fabrication techniques, and principles of operation of contemporary micro- and nanotechnologies used in lab-on-chip (LOC) type platforms. Small-scale subunit operations required in LOC systems, equally relevant across several disciplines in both life sciences and engineering fields, will be covered in detail. The knowledge acquired in these topics will be used during the last part of the course to analyze the design of LOC-based systems in key applications in different areas including biosensing, biotechnology and emerging energy technologies. CHEE 223 Fluid Mechanics Principles of mass, momentum and energy transport are applied to the analysis of fluid systems commonly encountered in chemical engineering practice. This approach is via the macroscopic and differential balances of mass, momentum and energy. Topics include fluid statics, incompressible flow in closed conduits, flow and pressure measurement, transportation of fluids, laminar, turbulent and creeping flows, and boundary layer effects. The design component of this course involves the determination of commercial components (piping, tubing, valves, pressure and flow meters and other fittings, as well as pumps) for fluid transport systems in industrial settings. CHEE 224 Transport Phenomena Fundamentals The theory and mathematical framework of transport phenomena are introduced. Mass, energy and momentum balances are developed using the integral and differential methods of analysis. The tools used to formulate and solve the problems include representation of physical entities in vector form, multivariable functions and vector operations in 2D and 3D. Specific topics of Chemical Engineering interest include moments of a force, work done by a force, moments of inertia, control surfaces and control volumes and fluid kinematics (21/0/0/21/0).
