With a background in Engineering and Pacific/Asian studies, I believe that all research should be transdisciplinary, incorporating the diversity and complexity of the techno, economic, social, and cultural factors that underpin all aspects of human's actions. Alongside my research work, I am interested in Humanitarian Engineering and the foundational role it should play in engineering practice, and understanding the process of decolonising methodologies to allow engagement with First Nations people and Indigenous knowledge systems. sustainable development humanitarian engineering renewable energy systems decarbonisation Transdisciplinary methods Indigenous knowledge systems data analysis Current student projects Supervisor Neighbourhood Battery Initiative (NBI) Impact of Neighbourhood Batteries on Decarbonisation Neighbourhood Battery Initiative (NBI) Upgrading the Electricity Network to Support Rooftop Solar PV Energy Generation Updated:10 August 2021/Responsible Officer:Dean, CECS/Page Contact:CECS Marketing Contact ANU Copyright Disclaimer Privacy Freedom of Information +61 2 6125 5111 The Australian National University, Canberra CRICOS Provider : 00120C ABN : 52 234 063 906 You appear to be using Internet Explorer 7, or have compatibility view turned on.
