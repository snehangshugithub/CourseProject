The majority of my recent work involves the development and use of algorithms for modeling the interface between two materials that are subject to the equations of motion governing the flow of a fluid, such as the compressible Euler equations (i.e., gas dynamics) or the incompressible Euler or Navier-Stokes equations. Examples of problems I have worked on include the refraction of a shock wave at the interface between two gases, the impact of two solids in the hydrostatic limit, (e.g., meteorite impact), and the microscale jetting of a fluid (e.g., ink jet printing).
