Some of his recent projects include the development of active vibration control devices using polymer-metal nano-fibers, the development of efficient balancing techniques to reduce vibrations in turbo-machinery rotors and the formulation of system identification strategies for the reliable modeling of machine and structural dynamic behavior based on vibration measurements.
