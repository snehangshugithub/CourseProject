Katz Larger Photo Randy H. Katz Professor Info Links Research Areas Computer Architecture & Engineering (ARC) Operating Systems & Networking (OSNT) Distributed and networked systems design and implementation Biography He received his undergraduate degree from Cornell University, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from UC Berkeley. He joined the Berkeley faculty in 1983, where, since 1996, he has been the United Microelectronics Corporation Distinguished Professor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He is a Fellow of the ACM and the IEEE, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has published over 250 refereed technical papers, book chapters, and books. His textbook, Contemporary Logic Design, has sold over 85,000 copies, and has been used at over 200 colleges and universities. A second edition, co-written with Gaetano Borriello, was published in 2005.He has supervised 43 M.S. theses and 31 Ph.D. dissertations (including one ACM Dissertation Award winner and eight women), and leads a research team of over ten graduate students, technical staff, and academic visitors. His recognitions include thirteen best paper awards (including one "test of time" paper award and one selected for a 50 year retrospective on IEEE Communications publications), three best presentation awards, the Outstanding Alumni Award of the UCB Computer Science Division, the CRA Outstanding Service Award, the Berkeley Distinguished Teaching Award, the Air Force Exceptional Civilian Service Decoration, the IEEE Reynolds Johnson Information Storage Award, the ASEE Frederic E. Terman Award, and the ACM Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award. In the late 1980s, with colleagues at Berkeley, he developed Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID), a $25 billion per year industry sector. While on leave for government service in 1993-1994, he established whitehouse.gov and connected the White House to the Internet.
