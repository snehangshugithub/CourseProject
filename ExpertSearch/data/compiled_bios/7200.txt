Concurrently, he was a Lecturer in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Siena College from 2005-2017, where he taught courses in General Chemistry and Environmental Chemistry. Previous experience includes a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry at the University of Illinois and 5 years with TRW Space and Defense (currently Northrup Grumman) in Redondo Beach, California and GE Global R&D in Niskayuna, New York. He currently holds eight US patents primarily in the areas of microelectronic processing, combinatorial chemistry, and advanced coatings for jet engines. Dr. LaGraff has presented over 60 invited and contributed talks; and is the author of about 30 papers, book chapters, and a book on Materials Chemistry.
