M., Hayden, P., Guha, S. 2012; 108 (14) Abstract Recent work has precisely characterized the achievable trade-offs between three key information processing tasks-classical communication (generation or consumption), quantum communication (generation or consumption), and shared entanglement (distribution or consumption), measured in bits, qubits, and ebits per channel use, respectively. Slices and corner points of this three-dimensional region reduce to well-known protocols for quantum channels. A trade-off coding technique can attain any point in the region and can outperform time sharing between the best-known protocols for accomplishing each information processing task by itself. Previously, the benefits of trade-off coding that had been found were too small to be of practical value (viz., for the dephasing and the universal cloning machine channels). In this Letter, we demonstrate that the associated performance gains are in fact remarkably high for several physically relevant bosonic channels that model free-space or fiber-optic links, thermal-noise channels, and amplifiers. We show that significant performance gains from trade-off coding also apply when trading photon-number resources between transmitting public and private classical information simultaneously over secret-key-assisted bosonic channels.

R., Piot, B. A., Hayden, P., Sarma, S. D., Gervais, G., Pfeiffer, L. N., West, K. W. 2008; 101 (18) Abstract Using a tilted-field geometry, the effect of an in-plane magnetic field on the even denominator nu=5/2 fractional quantum Hall state is studied. The energy gap of the nu=5/2 state is found to collapse linearly with the in-plane magnetic field above approximately 0.5 T. In contrast, a strong enhancement of the gap is observed for the nu=7/3 state. The radically distinct tilted-field behavior between the two states is discussed in terms of Zeeman and magneto-orbital coupling within the context of the proposed Moore-Read Pfaffian wave function for the 5/2 fractional quantum Hall effect.

R., Piot, B. A., Hayden, P., Das Sarma, S., Gervais, G., Pfeiffer, L. N., West, K. W. 2008; 100 (14) Abstract The fractional quantum Hall effect is observed at low magnetic field where the cyclotron energy is smaller than the Coulomb interaction energy. The nu=5/2 excitation gap at 2.63 T is measured to be 262+/-15 mK, similar to values obtained in samples with twice the electronic density. Examining the role of disorder on the 5/2 state, we find that a large discrepancy remains between theory and experiment for the intrinsic gap extrapolated from the infinite mobility limit. The observation of a 5/2 state in the low-field regime suggests that inclusion of nonperturbative Landau level mixing may be necessary to fully understand the energetics of half-filled fractional quantum Hall liquids.

However, when committing to a string of n bits at once, how far can we stretch the quantum limits? In this Letter, we introduce a framework of quantum schemes where Alice commits a string of n bits to Bob, in such a way that she can only cheat on a bits and Bob can learn at most b bits of information before the reveal phase. Our results are twofold: we show by an explicit construction that in the traditional approach, where the reveal and guess probabilities form the security criteria, no good schemes can exist: a + b is at least n. If, however, we use a more liberal criterion of security, the accessible information, we construct schemes where a = 4log2(n) + O(1) and b = 4, which is impossible classically. Our findings significantly extend known no-go results for quantum bit commitment.

In the nonoblivious scenario, the sender has a classical description of the state to be communicated. Our method can be used to communicate states that are pure or entangled with the sender's system; l+o(l) and 3l+o(l) shared random bits are sufficient, respectively.
