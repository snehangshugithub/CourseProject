Chemistry, University of Asmara, Asmara, Eritrea, 1993M.S. Inorganic Chemistry and Catalysis, Clark Atlanta University, 1998Ph.D. Inorganic Chemistry, University of Nevada-Reno, 2003Postdoctoral Research Associate, Iowa State University, 2003-2005 Research Interests Organometallic chemistry, Bioinorganic chemistry, Materials chemistry, CatalysisThe main focus of our research interests are in ligand design, synthetic organometallic chemistry, and materials chemistry with an emphasis on the synthesis of metal complexes with potential applications in catalysis, and as therapeutic agents. In one of our research projects, we are exploring the design, and synthesis of new ruthenium based compounds containing ligands modified with fluorescent chromophores, study their solution chemistry, and investigating their reactivity with DNA model nucleobases. We are also exploring the potential of the fluorescent properties of the ligands for the synthesis and development of photoactivated metal based therapeutic agents. Fluorescent properties of the ligands also offer the potential for following complexes reactivity with biomolecules or in catalytic applications. The second project involves the synthesis and characterization of ionic liquid functionalized mesoporous and nanoporous silica materials with potential application in catalysis, separation, and the synthesis of luminescent lanthanide compounds.

Research Grant and Mentoring Hampton University Faculty Research Fund (2013- ) Ruthenium(II)-Arene Complexes with Naphthalimide-Tagged Ligands as Potential Anticancer Agents. The overall goal of the research activities is to design and synthesize new ligands that possess specific features to enhance target specificity and improve the overall efficacy of ruthenium based therapeutic agents. Specifically, with the aim of improving the specificity of ruthenium(II)-arene complexes towards DNA, we are exploring the synthesis of multifunctional ligands whose DNA binding properties can be reversibly switched upon irradiation with light.
