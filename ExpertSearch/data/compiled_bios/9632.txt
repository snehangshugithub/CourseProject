She is also the James and Marsha McCormick Director of the Nancy E. and Peter C. Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering. Professor van der Meulen received her B.S. from MIT and M.S. and Ph.D. from Stanford University. Before joining the faculty at Cornell, she worked for three years as a biomedical engineer at the Rehabilitation R&D Center of the Department of Veteran Affairs, in Palo Alto, California. In 1995, she received an NIH FIRST Award and in 1999 an NSF Faculty Early Career Development Award. She is member ofthe American and European Societies of Biomechanicsand the Orthopaedic Research Society. She is a fellow of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR), the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Professor van der Meulen is also vice presidentof the Orthopaedic Research Society, Deputy Editor for the Journal of Orthopaedic Research, member of the NIH Skeletal Biology, Structure and Regeneration study section, and steering committee member for the IBMS Sun Valley Workshop on Musculoskeletal Biology.Steven Adie Associate Professor, Associate Director, Director of Undergraduate StudiesSteven Adie completed a BSc with First Class Honours in Chemical Physics in 1997 and earned a Ph.D. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (specializing in Biomedical Optics) in 2007, both from The University of Western Australia. Between his undergraduate and graduate studies he worked as a Research Engineer at Q-Vis Limited a startup company to commercialize solid-state laser technology for LASIK eye surgery. After completing his Ph.D., he did a postdoc in the Biophotonics Imaging Laboratory at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 2013 he started as an Assistant Professor in the Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering, where his group develops novel optical coherence elastography and computational optical coherence microscopy approaches for mechanobiology and neuroscience research. Dr. Adie is the recipient of the NSF CAREER Award, NIBIB Trailblazer Award, and the Cornell Discovery and Innovation Research Seed Award.Jan Lammerding Professor, Co-Director of Graduate StudiesJan Lammerding is a Professor in the Nancy E. and Peter C. Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering and the Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology at Cornell University. After obtaining a Diploma Ingenieur degree in Mechanical Engineering in his native Germany, he completed his Ph.D. in Biological Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) studying subcellular biomechanics and mechanotransduction signaling in the laboratories of Roger Kamm (MIT) and Richard T. Lee (Harvard Medical School/Brigham and Women's Hospital). Before joining Cornell University, Dr. Lammerding served as a faculty member at Harvard Medical School/Brigham and Women's Hospital while also teaching in the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT. Dr. Lammerding has won several prestigious awards, including a National Science Foundation CAREER Award, an American Heart Association Scientist Development Grant, and the BWH Department of Medicine Young Investigator Award. Dr. Lammerding was featured as one of the 2014 Young Innovators in the Cell and Molecular Bioengineering Journal. Dr. Lammerding has published over 50 peer-reviewed articles, including in Nature, Science, and PNAS. His research is supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program.Peter Doerschuk Professor, Co-Director of Graduate StudiesBefore joining Cornell University in July 2006, Peter Doerschuk was on the faculty of Purdue University in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Biomedical Engineering. He received B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from MIT and an M.D. degree from Harvard Medical School. After post-graduate training at Brigham and Women'sHospital he held a post-doctoral appointment at the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (MIT) before joining Purdue.At Purdue University he organized the graduate program of the Biomedical Engineering program and then department in the late 1990s and did a lot of work associated with the founding of the department in 1998 and the start of an undergraduate degree program soon thereafter. At Cornell University he was responsible for organizing the Ph.D. program in Biomedical Engineering as the Director of Graduate Studies for the Biomedical Engineering Graduate Field for about 8 years and, partly at the same time, was responsible for the Master of Engineering program in Biomedical Engineering. These programs have grown rapidly since the start of the School of Biomedical Engineering in 2004 and in 2019 have about 20 new Ph.D. students and 60 new M.Eng. students per year.Newton de Faria Professor of Practice,Director of Master's of Engineering ProgramDr. de Faria earned his Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 1998. He brings nearly two decades of experience working in industry and has held numerous teaching appointments. For the last decade, he has focused on medical devices, analytical devices and pharmaceutical application markets in the biomedical and health industries. He has worked as the Senior District Sales Manager and Strategic Accounts Manager for National Instruments Corporation. He has taught BME 6500, Biomedical Instrumentation, at the University of Connecticut. Dr. de Faria brings a passion for accelerating productivity, innovation, and discovery in the biomedical industry. He will prepare Master of Engineering students for a wide range of careers by incorporating BME industry-oriented training using a design-centric approach. Our graduates will be prepared to address engineering challenges in the regulatory environment associated with modern healthcare. We will benefit greatly from his breadth of experience and commitment to education. We are delighted to have Dr. de Faria serve in this vitally important role and anticipate great success under his leadership.
