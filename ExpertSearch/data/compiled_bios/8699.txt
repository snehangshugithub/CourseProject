Advisors/Mentors can provide information on the four-year guarantee program, designed to ensure a student takes the correct classes in order to graduate in four years. Graduating students are advised to visit their Advisor/Mentorthe semester prior to graduation, in order to ensure the degree requirements have been met. Students will also be assigned a Faculty Advisor/Mentor in order to guide their academic progress while pursuing a degree in Physics. Students must meet with their assigned Faculty Mentor at least once a semester; new students will not be able to register for classes until they have met with their Faculty Advisor/Mentor. Meeting with an Advisor/Mentor Students should prepare for a meeting with an Advisor/Mentor by knowing their current schedule and their plans for the future. Students should bring anadvising form, and should visit faculty mentors during their office hours. Assignments by last name are intended for initial visits. Students are encouraged to work with the same advisor over the course of their academic career, when feasible. Note: During the summer, faculty advisors and mentors do not hold weekly office hours. Please email your advisor or mentor for assistance.
