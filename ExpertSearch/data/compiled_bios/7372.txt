A.B., Mathematics, University of Chicago, USA, 1995. Research Interests My graduate research work is in the field of symplectic geometry and moment maps, an abstraction of classical Hamiltonian dynamics with symmetry. I currently direct the service-level division of the math departments undergraduate program and lead the Clinical Faculty team. We manage the coordination of calculus courses, provide professional development for new teaching assistants and postdocs, and advise students. Professionally I am interested in teacher education, teaching methods, and technological tools in the classroom. Selected Publications M.
