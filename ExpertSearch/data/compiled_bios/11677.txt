Prior to joining the University of Waterloo, Prof. Tavassoti worked as an Assistant Research Professor at the Thomas D. Larson Transportation Institute of the Pennsylvania State University. His research revolves around promoting sustainability and resilience of the transportation infrastructure with a focus on an enhanced pavement engineering, design, and materials characterization framework. To this end, he has been actively working on collaborative research with several colleagues from across Canada and internationally for over the past 12 years. In 2020, Prof. Tavassoti was elected to serve a 5-year term as the vice chair of the Ontario Asphalt Expert Task Group (OAETG), where he is currently working with experts from the academia, transportation industry, government agencies, municipalities, and consultants to address some of the pressing issues affecting the quality of the pavement network in Canada. At the international level, Prof. Tavassoti is an active member of the International Union of Laboratories and Experts in Construction Materials, Systems and Structures (RILEM). At RILEM, he is serving as the leader of the bituminous binders fingerprinting Task Group of the TC FBB. In this capacity, he is working with experts from over 18 different countries on utilizing advanced materials characterization techniques and Artificial Intelligence to bridge the gap between the chemo-physical properties of the bituminous mixes and their performance characteristics. Prof. Tavassoti is also the co-founder of the National Transportation Infrastructure Research Center (NTIRC) at the K.N.Toosi University of Technology, where he used to serve as the core faculty member until 2012.Research InterestsSmart Pavements and Connected Transportation InfrastructureModern Pavement InstrumentationNon-destructive Testing and Evaluation (NDT/E)Advanced Construction Materials CharacterizationSustainable Materials and Green Construction TechnologiesRecycled Materials Valorization in PavementsApplication of NanotechnologyEnhanced Pavement Design and Performance Prediction Application of Artificial Intelligence to Pavement Engineering Problems3D Printing of Cementitious MaterialsImplications of Climate Change for Pavement Design and Assest ManagementMultistakeholder Planning in Pavement Engineering and ManagementEducation2016, Doctorate, Civil Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University2010, Master of Science, Civil Engineering, K.N.Toosi University of Technology2007, Bachelor of Science (BSc), Civil Engineering, University of GuilanCourses*CIVE 542 - Pavement Structural DesignTaught in 2020, 2021* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsSaliani, S.
