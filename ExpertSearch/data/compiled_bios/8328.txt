We utilize molecular scale building blocks made from new 2D materials like graphene and molybdenum disulfide. The materials are naturally stable at only one to a few atoms thick and can be grown or manually manipulated to build heterostructures with tailored properties by stacking 2D materials layer-by-layer, like lego building blocks. These new structures are then used in applications that lie at the forefront of nanotechnology such as highly-tunable nano-electro-mechanical systems, flexible electronics, pushing Moore's Law, sensors, biological interfaces and new energy systems.
