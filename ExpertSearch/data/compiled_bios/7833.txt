Afterward, he moved to the University of California, Santa Barbara as a postdoctoral associate. In 2011, he joined the Cornell faculty of Applied and Engineering Physics. In 2012 he received a Young Investigator Award from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, in 2013 he received an Early Faculty Career Award from the National Science Foundation along with the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, and in 2014 he received the Early Career Award from the Department of Energy.Research InterestsThe Fuchs Group isfocused onspintronics and quantum information science. We study and manipulate spin and optical degrees of freedom in solid-state materials. To do this, we draw inspiration from many fields including atomic physics, materials science, and electrical engineering.We are interested in hybrid quantum systems, in which disparate degrees of freedom interact coherently. Such systems can form the basis of future quantum technologies such as quantum repeaters and quantum transducers. Diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect centers are an important platform for our research because they possess a coherent optical transition, long-lived spin coherence, and several mechanisms for coupling to external degrees of freedom mechanical, magnetic, and electrical. NV center-based hybrid systems can also form outstanding quantum-enhanced sensors for a range of applications from nanoscience to navigation. We are also interested in developing new quantum platforms and hybrid quantum systems in the solid-state using isolated defect centers in 2D materials and their heterostructures.Another focus is understanding spins and spin dynamics in materials to enable future technologies based on spin. We are interested in spin-orbit torques and exotic spin order including antiferromagnetic, multiferroic, and chiral magnetic materials. One important tool in our research is the time-resolved magneto-thermal microscope a unique table-top magnetic microscope that we have developed over the past several years. Our microscope draws its contrast from spin-thermal interactions including the anomalous Nernst effect and the spin Seebeck effect, converting spatiotemporal thermal transport into a time-resolved image of magnetic order in a material. This approach is surprisingly versatile: we have imaged spin texture in magnetic metals, magnetic insulators, antiferromagnetic metals, and antiferromagnetic insulators.NanotechnologyCondensed Matter and Material PhysicsOptical Physics and Quantum Information ScienceSelected Publications1.
