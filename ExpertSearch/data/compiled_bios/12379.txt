Fink Margaret and Herman Sokol Professor; American Cancer Society Professor of Genetics; Member, Whitehead Institute Gerald R. Fink investigates how fungal pathogens invade the body, evade the immune system, and establish an infection. 617-258-5215 Phone WI-561F Office gfink@wi.mit.edu Email Lab Website Beverly Dobson Assistant 617-258-5214 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1965, Yale University BA, 1962, Biology, Amherst College Research Summary We study the molecules that allow fungi to penetrate tissues and grow in a hostile environment. Using genetics, biochemistry and genomics, we answer questions such as: What makes Candida albicans such a successful pathogen? How do fungal pathogens evolve antibiotic resistance? How do they manage to change their genetic composition so rapidly? The Fink lab is no longer accepting students. Awards Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal, Genetics Society of America, 2020 James R.
