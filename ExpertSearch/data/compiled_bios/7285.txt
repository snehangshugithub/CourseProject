Specifically, we focus on creating simple, but novel methods to control nano- and micro-structure of synthetic and biological materials inspired by nature and further modulate chemical and physical properties of materials. In addition, we are exploring use of the resulting matters in multiple applications including drug delivery, anti-fouling, diagnosis/bioimaging, drug/cell therapies, and biomachinery. In this context, our current research projects include; Active matters (e.g., hydrogels & colloids doped with catalysts) for molecular and cell therapies of ischemic injury, inflammation, and infection Modular assembly of nano- and micro-sized stimulus-responsive materials for drug and cell delivery Stretchable and tough hydrogels for minimally invasive delivery, surgical simulation, and werable electronics Bio and abiotic soft machinery and organoids For more information Kong Group Web site Research Synopsis Books Edited or Co-Edited (Original Editions) Stem cells and revascularization therapies.
