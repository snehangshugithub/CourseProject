Ko is a Professor at the University of Washington Information School and an Adjunct Associate Professor at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering. She directs the Code & Cognition Lab, where she studies human aspects of programming. Her earliest work included techniques for automatically answering questions about program behavior to support debugging, program understanding, and reuse. Her later work studied interactions between developers and users, and techniques for web scale aggregation of user intent through help systems; she co-founded AnswerDash to commercialize these ideas. Her latest work investigates programming skills and new methods for learning them, including the programming language knowledge, APIs knowledge, and programming strategies. Her work spans over 80 peer-reviewed publications, 11 receiving best paper awards and 4 receiving most influential paper awards. She received her Ph.D. at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in 2008, and degrees in Computer Science and Psychology with Honors from Oregon State University in 2002.
