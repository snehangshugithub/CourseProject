The materials of interest include transition metal oxides, iron-based superconductors, and heavy fermion systems in both bulk and nano-structured forms. Current state-of-the-art first-principles approaches are adopted including dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and density functional theory (DFT). Dr. Park also has been working on the development of new implementations such as the calculations of total electronic energies and magnetic excitation spectra using DFT+DMFT as well as the inclusion of non-local correlation effects beyond DMFT.
