She analyzed Drosophilatelomeres, and discovered that they are maintained by special transposable elements called retrotransposons. TheDrosophilatelomeric retrotransposons are unusual transposable elements, and provide a link between telomeres and transposable elements that raises interesting questions about the evolution of both eukaryotic chromosomes and transposable elements.
