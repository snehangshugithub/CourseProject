Jeffrey Saucerman, Professor of Biomedical Engineering Our lab combines computational modeling and high-throughput experiments to discover molecular networks and drugs that control cardiac remodeling and regeneration. Our experimental approaches include high-throughput microscopy and -omic profiling of primary and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. Our computational approaches include large-scale regulatory network modeling and bioinformatic analysis of -omic data. Specific focus areas include: cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and death extra-cellular matrix remodeling by fibroblasts and macrophages cardiomyocyte proliferation Awards Pinn Scholars Award 2018 NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award 2013 Dean's Excellence in Teaching Award 2012 Member, Academy of Distinguished Educators 2012 American Heart Association National Scientist Development Grant 2008 FEST Distinguished Young Investigator Grant 2007 Research Interests Systems Biology Cardiovascular Disease Regenerative Medicine Machine Learning and Data Science Cellular and Molecular Engineering Fibrosis Jeffrey Saucerman, PhD, Professor of Biomedical Engineering, combines computational models and high-throughput experiments to discover molecular networks that control cardiac remodeling and regeneration.

We are combining high-throughput microscopy, automated image processing, and large-scale network modeling to address these challenges. Cardiac inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling Cardiac macrophages and fibroblasts play important roles in inflammation and wound healing following cardiac injury. Yet systems and therapeutic approaches targeting these cells have been limited. We are collaborating with investigators at UVA and externally to reconstruct the molecular networks in fibroblasts and macrophages in the context of myocardial infarction. Cardiac regeneration While cardiac regeneration was once thought to be limited to organisms such newts and zebrafish, recent studies have demonstrated that mammals also have some regenerative capacity. We are combining genomic and high-throughput microscopy experiments with computational models to map the molecular networks and identify compounds that stimulate cardiac myocyte proliferation.
