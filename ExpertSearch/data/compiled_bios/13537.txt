In 1993, I incorporated as Huntrods Consulting Inc. In 2003, I changed to a numbered company (1056573 Alberta Inc.) where I am President and Senior Software Engineer. In the beginning, I used my expertise as a programmer and my Chemical Engineering background to develop efficient user interface packages for Oil and Gas software. I also developed state-of-the-art graphics packages for medical applications (i.e. evoked brain potential mapping). I also developed musical packages including a full MIDI engine for a commercial sound card. More recently, I have been developing fully hosted "thin client" software for the educational and human resources industry. These packages take advantage of the internet to deliver quality applications anywhere in the world using Open Source enterprise technologies.[top]Industry Experience1998-2001: Instructor and Coordinator (Program Chair), Southern AlbertaInstitute of Technology.
