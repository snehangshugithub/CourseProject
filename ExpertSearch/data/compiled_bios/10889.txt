The nature of dark matter still remains unknown and is recognized as one of the greatest puzzles in science today. There are a variety of dark matter particle candidates within different extended particle physics models, but particular focus has been given to weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Recently, we have entered the era of experimental data by using three complementary detection methods: production in particle accelerators, direct detection of scattering in terrestrial detectors and indirect detection of products from dark matter particle annihilation in the galactic halo.
