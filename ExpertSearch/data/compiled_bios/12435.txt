We support a broad range of interests, examining amino acid metabolism in Corynebacterium glutamicum, bioremediation and bioconversion processes in Rhodococcus, and biopolymer synthesis in Gram-negative bacteria. As for eukaryotic systems, we study both lipid biosynthesis and embryogensis in oil palm, as well as the accumulation of secondary metabolites in tropical plants.
