Kaiser Amgen Professor of Biology Before closing his lab, Chris A. Kaiser analyzed protein folding and trafficking in cells. 617-253-9804 Phone 68-330 Office ckaiser@mit.edu Email Gina Lee Assistant 617-258-6473 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1987, MIT Research Summary The Kaiser lab studied protein folding and intracellular trafficking in the yeast S. cerevisiae. Their work focused on the protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), quality control mechanisms in the ER, and membrane protein sorting in Golgi compartments. They combined genetic, biochemical, and cell biological methods to gain an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying each of these processes. Chris Kaiser is no longer accepting students.
