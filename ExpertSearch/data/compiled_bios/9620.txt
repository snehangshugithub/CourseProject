His research group develops and implements systems bioengineering approaches to study the transcriptional and signaling network dysregulations underlying the decline of muscle stem cell function and tissue regeneration in aging and disease.The Cosgrove Laboratory is a group of biomedical engineers, stem cell biologists, and systems biologists that are broadly interested in understanding how muscle stem cells use the integrative action of their regulatory circuitry to interpret and balance diverse streams of microenvironmental "information". They explorethese questions by: (1) Developing single-cell analysis and modeling approaches to deconstruct how muscle stem cell fate outcomes are dictated by diverse niche microenvironmental signals;(2) Elucidating the logic of autocrine and paracrine signaling networks influencing muscle stem cells fate decisions in homeostatic and regenerating muscle; and(3) Engineering biomimetic microenvironments for evaluating stem cell-niche interactions and exploiting them for cell manufacturing application. These approaches will enable the improvement of rationally designed, quantitatively predicable stem cell-targeted regenerative medicine therapies to treat tissue aging and degeneration.

His research has been supported by a Whitaker Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, a Stanford Molecular Imaging Scholars Fellowship, multiple NIH Awards (K99/R00, R01, and two R21 Grants), and a Glenn Medical Research Foundation/American Federation for Aging Research Grant for Junior Faculty. His research has been recognized by a Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) Graduate Research Award (2008), a Rising Star Award from the Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering Special Interest Group of BMES (2015), and a Young Innovator of Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering Award (2017). His instruction has received a Swanson Teaching Excellence Award (2019) from the Cornell University College of Engineering.Research InterestsBioengineeringBiomechanics and MechanobiologyBiomedical EngineeringComputational Science and EngineeringMolecular and Cellular EngineeringSystems and Synthetic BiologyTissue Engineering and BiomaterialsSelected PublicationsMcKellar DW, Walter LD, Song LT, Mantri M, Wang MFZ, De Vlaminck I, Cosgrove BD.
