As migration is the movement to and away from areas where organisms breed, each trip is composed of multiple steps or substages. These trips occur twice yearly and involve sequential development of the neuroendocrine, endocrine, metabolic, and behavioral systems (no name just a few). Progression from one substage to the next is influenced by environmental signals or proximate factors. Currently, these studies involve the effects of various factors on the development and expression of the physiological and behavioral states of migration. These include alterations in appetite that lead to increased feeding and fattening, expression of specific behaviors characteristic in captive migrants and termination of the stage altogether. Other studies include vocal communication of nocturnal migrants, behavior associated with celestial navigation during migration, role of circadian rhythms and environmental cues in the regulation of day and nighttime behaviors of migrants. In addition endocrine and neuroendocrine aspects of these processes are ongoing. B.A. Botany-Biology, Pomona College, Claremont, California (1969). M.Sc.
