After three months of research, I had learned basic sampling theory, how to use Matlab to build and train a neural network, and how to identify a linear system from input-output measurements all before I knew the definition of the Laplace transform. That early opportunity to stretch beyond my training had a tremendous influence on the evolution of my career. As a member of the AOE faculty, I enthusiastically promote similar extracurricular engineering opportunities for our own students, including engineering design competitions, undergraduate research, and internships or cooperative employment. Courses I have taught at Virginia Tech include AOE 3034 System Dynamics and Control AOE 3104 Aircraft Performance AOE 3134 Air Vehicle Dynamics AOE 3234 Ocean Vehicle Dynamics AOE 4004 State-Space Control AOE 4984 Navigation and Guidance AOE 6744 Linear Control Theory AOE 5774 Nonlinear Systems Theory AOE 6984 Geometric Mechanics and Control AOE 6984 System Identification Research expertise My research interests are in the nonlinear dynamics and control of ocean and atmospheric vehicles. A unifying theme of my group's research is the development of energy-based nonlinear guidance and control methods that enable effective vehicle operation over a broader performance envelope than conventional, linear methods allow. Disciplinary areas of expertise include: Lyapunov-based nonlinear control; nonlinear guidance; path/motion planning; vision-based control; biomimetic locomotion; multi-body dynamics; and autonomous system reliability. Application areas of expertise include: fixed-wing and multi-rotor aircraft, ocean surface vessels, and subsurface ocean vessels at all scales; vehicle autonomy for unmanned aircraft, unmanned surface vessels, and unmanned underwater vehicles; and in-situ sensing of ocean and atmospheric phenomena.
