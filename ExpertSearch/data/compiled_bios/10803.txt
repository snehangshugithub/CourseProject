In terms of applications, we are researching solar cells, electronic/spintronic devices, dental/bone repair, and cancer curing, among others. Regardingmaterialswe are actively developing include conjugated organic/polymers, biocompatible polymers, traditional polymers, and inorganic/organic hybrids. Our strengths are inchemistry, including design and synthesis of organic molecules and polymers, and also exploring new polymerization methodologies. Ourmissionis to apply innovative approaches to develop novel materials for various applications. Please visit ourgroup page for more information and related publications. Applied Physical Sciences lives in the collaborative space between science and engineering, combining knowledge and discovery with an engineering mindset, team-based science, and entrepreneurship to address real-world problems. The Department of Applied Physical Sciences believes that diversity, equity, and inclusion are crucial to our pursuit of excellence, and is deeply committed to creating a diverse and inclusive community.
