They can identify a specific chemical odor that they have experienced with electric shock and avoid it. Moreover, they can remember to avoid it for several days. Before closing his lab, the Quinn lab investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying learning acquisition and memory storage by inducing and selecting single-gene mutations that affect learning or memory, and by engineering transgenic fly strains that disrupt these processes. William Quinn is no longer accepting students. Key PublicationsThe amnesiac gene product is expressed in two neurons in the Drosophila brain that are critical for memory.
