Watson, Sr. Professor of Science, Professor of Neuroscience, Reliance Dhirubhai Ambani Director of the Robert J. and Nancy D. Carney Institute for Brain Science Overview I graduated with a PhD in Pharmacology from University College London in 1986 and then studiedwith Richard W Tsienas a postdoctoral associate at Yale University School of Medicine and subsequently at Stanford University Medical School.In 1992 I joined the Department of Neuroscience at Brown. Istudy the expression, regulation, andfunctionof voltage-gated calcium ion channels in different regions of the nervous system. I am alsointerested in their role in chronic pain and psychiatric disorders.Iwork closely with undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral trainees. I am the Director ofthe Robery J. & Nancy D. Carney Institute for Brain Science and direct NIH funded Predoctoral Training Programs in Neuroscience.

Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview We are interested in the cellular mechanisms used to optimize calcium ion channel function. Calcium ion channels regulate many critical neuronal functions including transmitter release, nerve growth, and synaptic plasticity. Our current research focus is on cell-specific alternative splicing in the mammalian nervous system. We study cellular mechanisms that control calcium channel function in normal as well as in disease states, including chronic pain and mental illness. Research Statement Voltage-gated calcium channels, the gatekeepers of excitation-driven calcium entry in all excitable cells, control a diverse array of functions. Alternative splicing expands functional capabilities and contributes greatly to the expansion of the proteome required to support complex brain functions. We study alternative splicing of voltage-gated calcium channels. Our work is relevant to basic mechanisms that control channel function in normal and in disease states, including chronic pain and mental illness.
