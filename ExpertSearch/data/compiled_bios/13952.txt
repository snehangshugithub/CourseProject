Current areas of interest include risk-based and model-based design, system analysis and optimization, computational design, collaborative design, systems engineering, and reliability engineering as applied to the design of large scale complex engineered systems such as aircraft, spacecraft, automobiles, nuclear power plants, power grid, etc. Biography: Irem Tumer is a professor at Oregon State University, where she leads the Complex Engineered System Design group within the Design Engineering Labs. She is an expert in system-level design and analysis for software-intensive engineered systems, focusing on the development of model-based design and risk-based design methodologies for use in the early stages of the complex system design process. Her extensive experience at NASA and in the Engineering Design community has led to over 100 publications. She has been extensively funded through various NASA programs while leading the Complex Systems Design group during her time at NASA Ames Research Center between 1998 and 2006. Since moving to Oregon State University in 2006, her funding has largely been through NSF, AFOSR, DARPA, and NASA. Prior to accepting a faculty position at OSU, Prof. Tumer led the Complex Systems Design and Engineering group in the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames Research Center, where she worked from 1998 through 2006 as Research Scientist, Group Lead, and Program Manager. Professor Tumer has been conference chair for ASMEs Design for Manufacturing and the Lifecycle conference in 2000, program chair for IEEE Reliability Societys Prognostics and Health Management Conference in 2008, and program chair (2011) and conference chair (2012) for ASMEs International Design Theory and Methodology Conference; and is current associate editor for ASME Journal of Mechanical Design and the International Journal of Prognostics and Health Management, and guest editor for AIEDAM Journal. She is an ASME Fellow, and a member of SWE and ASEE. tumer.irem_.cv_.osu-august2020.pdf Future Students Current Students Alumni and Friends Industry and Partners Faculty and Staff Support MIME Contact Info School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering 204 Rogers Hall 2000 SW Monroe Avenue Oregon State University Corvallis, OR 97331-6001 Fax: 541-737-2600 info-mime@oregonstate.edu Undergrad Student Services Phone: 541-737-7009 Graduate Student Services Phone: 541-737-3441 mime.gradinfo@oregonstate.edu Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin Land Acknowledgement Copyright 2021 Oregon State University Disclaimer ABOUT US Overview Accreditation News RESEARCH Overview Research Areas Research Facilities PEOPLE Faculty Research Areas of Research Excellence Faculty & Staff Directory Graduate Students Class Composites Careers INDUSTRY RELATIONS Overview Events Calendar Capstone Design Join Our Mailing List Contact Us STUDENT INFORMATION Undergrad Advising Graduate Advising Undergrad Financial Info Graduate Financial Info MIME Student Groups
