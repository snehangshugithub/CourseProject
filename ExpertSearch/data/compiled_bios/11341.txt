Trinkle is a Willett Faculty Scholar and Professor in Materials Science and Engineering at Univ. Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and the Associate Head of Materials Science and Engineering. He received his Ph.D. in Physics from Ohio State University in 2003. Following his time as a National Research Council postdoctoral researcher at the Air Force Research Laboratory, he joined the faculty of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Univ. Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in 2006. He was a TMS Young Leader International Scholar in 2008, received the NSF/CAREER award in 2009, the Xerox Award for Faculty Research at Illinois in 2011, the AIME Robert Lansing Hardy Award in 2014, the TMS Brimacombe Medal in 2019, co-chaired the 2011 Physical Metallurgy Gordon Research conference, and became a Willett Faculty Scholar at Illinois in 2015, a Center for Advanced Study Associate and NCSA Faculty Fellow in 2017. His research focuses on computational methods for studying defects in materials at the atomic-scale using density-functional theory, and novel techniques to understand problems in mechanical behavior and transport. This has led to ab initio predictions of solid-solution softening in molybdenum, solute strengthening and softening in magnesium alloys, pipe diffusion of hydrogen in palladium, diffusion of oxygen in titanium and solutes in magnesium, among others. Research Statement Computational materials science: atomistics, electronic structure;Mechanical behavior: plasticity and phase transformation at atomistic scale;Defect properties: point defects, dislocations, interfaces;Transport: interstitial diffusion, vacancy-mediated diffusion.
