My research interests are physical layer wireless, distributed machine learning, edge networks, and industrial communications. I received a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering '16 and a master's degree in Information and Network Engineering '18 both from KTH - Royal Intitute of Technology. After the completion of my master's thesis, I spent a couple of months working as a temporary contractor for ABB Corporate Research, assisting in the development of a novel PHY-layer protocol for ultra-low latency industrial communications called WirelessHP. My current research focus is Wireless for Machine Learning, i.e.wireless networks protocols that are tailored to support distributed machine learning. Particularly, I focus on over-the-air computation to combine the gradients of deep neural networksby utilizing the superposition property of electromagnetic waves.
