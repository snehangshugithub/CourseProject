Shafer Smith Professor of Mathematics and Atmosphere/Ocean Science shafer@cims.nyu.edu 212-998-3176 Warren Weaver Hall, Office 916 http://math.nyu.edu/~shafer/ Education Ph.D., Physics, University of California, Santa Cruz, USA, 1999. B.S., Physics, Indiana University, Bloomington, USA, 1992. B.S., Mathematics, Indiana University, Bloomington, USA, 1992. Research Interests My research is focused on large-scale turbulence in planetary fluids, particularly Earth's oceans and atmosphere. I seek to understand how such turbulent motions conspire to transport heat and other constituents, and to improve the representation of these processes in global climate models.
