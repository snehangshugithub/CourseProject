Additionally, she works and writes on issues around ethics education for data professionals and computer scientists, focusing on the possibilities (and limits) of research ethics, ethics codes, and data metaphors for confronting the challenges posed by pervasive surveillance and data technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence.Anna Lauren Hoffmann is currently an Assistant Professor with The Information School at the University of Washington where she is also co-founder and co-director of the UW iSchool's AfterLab.
