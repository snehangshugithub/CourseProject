His research interests include Smart Prosthetics, Digital systems, Wearable Sensors, Biomedical signals and image processing, and Machine learning algorithms: Theory and Application. In the past, he has served as an Assistant Teaching Professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and as a Contract Lecturer at Ryerson University. At WPI, he worked on a myoelectric hand-wrist prosthesis, which involved research in algorithms, EMG signals, and machine learning. He also developed a 16 channel analog front end for EMG signal processing at WPI. He also worked as a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Institute for Diagnostic Imaging Research located at MaRS Discovery District, Toronto, ON, Canada. There, he continued his Ph.D. research for developing Portable Pulmonary Injuries Diagnostic device (PPIDD) meant to make a diagnosis of Pneumothorax on the spot.
