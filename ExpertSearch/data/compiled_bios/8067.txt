These applications include localized growth factor delivery for therapeutic angiogenesis and for stem cell differentiation, scaffolds for soft connective tissue engineering, and ocular drug delivery. Polymer systems being developed include biodegradable elastomers,electrospun crimped fibre scaffolds, injectable thermoplastics, and mechanically enhanced hydrogels. We are interested in elucidating the mechanisms of degradation of the polymers in vivo to better design these materials for given applications, determining the mechanisms governing drug release, the role polymer biomaterial mechanical properties play in mediating cell proliferation and differentiation, and in controlling polymer surface properties to improve cellular interactions. The work is multidisciplinary and we collaborate routinely with orthopaedic and cardiovascular surgeons, and colleagues in mechanical engineering and cell biology. Facilities Our polymer lab is located within the Biosciences Complex and currently has a Waters HPLC (UV-VIS, fluorescence) and GPC system complete with a Precision Detectors light-scattering detector, a Mettler-Toledo differential scanning calorimeter,a Biolin Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation, and an Instron tensile tester. Our cell culture and microscopy facilities are located in the Human Mobility Research Centre, where we presently have an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope, a Nicolet ATR-FTIR microscope, and a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Frequent use is made of the NMR and MS facilities in the Department of Chemistry, and a rheometer and dynamic mechanical analyzer within the Polymer Group Analytical Facility.
