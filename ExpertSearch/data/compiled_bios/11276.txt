His paper "Effects of Centralization on Expected Costs in a Multi-Location Newsboy Problem," Management Science 1979 was selected as one of the 50 most influential papers in the first 50 years of Management Science. He is also coauthor of the now-classic texts: Quantitative Concepts for Management: Decision Making without Algorithms; and Introductory Management Science. He currently serves as an independent director of Hub Group, Inc., and on the advisory board of the Power Cat Group, LLC. He held the position of director of Landauer Inc. from 1992 until 2007. Eppen earned a PhD in operations research from Cornell University in 1964, a master of science in industrial engineering from the University of Minnesota in 1960, a bachelor of science from the University of Minnesota in 1958, and an associate in arts degree in pre-engineering from Austin Junior College in 1956.
