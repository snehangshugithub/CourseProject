Until 1967, I worked with Olivetti, Olivetti-Bull, General Electric, and Siemens as a programmer and systems analyst. From 1967 to 1969 I was a Research Associate at the Institute for Computer Studies, University of Manitoba, where I obtained a MSc in Computer Science in 1969. I then obtained a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo in 1974. From 1973 to 2002 I have been with the University of Ottawa, first in the Department of Computer Science and then in the School of Information Technology and Engineering (SITE). I was Chair of the Computer Science Department from 1991 to 1997 and Administrative Director of SITE in 1997/98. I had sabbaticals at Bell Northern Research (which became Nortel), at the University of Twente (NL) and at the University of Stirling (Scotland). I have now retired from the University of Ottawa and since July 1, 2002 I am a professor at the nearby Universit du Qubec en Outaouais, Dpartement d'informatique et ingnierie.
