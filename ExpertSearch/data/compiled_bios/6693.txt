Additionally, Thomas is a Principal Investigator with MITs Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE). He directs the Integrative Neuromonitoring and Critical Care Informatics Group in IMES and RLE. Thomas interests began meandering between basic science and clinical medicine in his native Germany, where he started studying physics and medicine at Johannes Gutenberg-Universitt, Mainz, Germany. He subsequently received the MS and MPhil degrees in Physics from Yale University and the PhD degree in Medical Physics from the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology in 2004. He completed postdoctoral training with the Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems at MIT before heco-founded and co-directed the Computational Physiology and Clinical Inference Group at RLE. In addition to his MIT appointments, Thomas holds courtesy research appointments at Harvard Medical School, Boston Childrens Hospital (Neurology), Massachusetts General Hospital (Emergency Medicine), and Boston Medical Center (Neurosurgery). degrees PhD in Medical Physics, Health Sciences and Technology, MIT, 2004 MS and MPhil in Physics, Yale University, 1996 and 1998 research Thomass research interests focus on signal processing, mathematical modeling, and model identification to support real-time clinical decision making, monitoring of disease progression, and titration of therapy, primarily in neurocritical and neonatal critical care. In particular, Thomas is interested in developing a mechanistic understanding of physiologic systems, and in formulating appropriately chosen computational physiologic models for improved patient care. His research is conducted in close collaboration with colleagues at MIT and clinicians from Boston-area hospitals. selected publications Imaduddin SM, Fanelli A, Vonberg FW, Tasker RC, Heldt T.
