InterestsIt is an irony that often the more severe a person's motor impairment, the more challenging it is for them to operate the very assistive machines which might enhance their quality of life. A primary aim of my lab is to address this confound by incorporating robotics autonomy and intelligence into assistive machines---turning the machine into a kind of robot, and offloading some of the control burden from the user to the machine. Robots already synthetically sense, act in and reason about the world, and these technologies can be leveraged to help bridge the gap left by sensory, motor or cognitive impairments in the users of assistive machines.My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, rehabilitation robotics and machine learning. A distinguishing theme present within many of my lab's projects is that the machine automation is customizable---to a user's physical abilities, personal preferences or even financial means. A fundamental question that arises time and again throughout many of our projects is how exactly to share control between the robot and the human user, and how to adapt these control formulations over time as the human changes. We are working with a range of hardware platforms, from a smart wheelchair to assistive robotic arms.Selected PublicationsGopinath, Deepak E.; Argall, Brenna D., Active Intent Disambiguation for Shared Control Robots, IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering 28(6):1497-1506.Young, Michael; Javaremi, Mahdieh Nejati; Argall, Brenna D., Discrete N-Dimensional Entropy of Behavior, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.:2227-2233.Broad, Alexander; Abraham, Ian; Murphey, Todd; Argall, Brenna, Data-driven Koopman operators for model-based shared control of humanmachine systems, International Journal of Robotics Research 39(9):1178-1195.Javaremi, Mahdieh Nejati; Young, Michael; Argall, Brenna Dee, Interface Operation and Implications for Shared-Control Assistive Robots, IEEE ...
