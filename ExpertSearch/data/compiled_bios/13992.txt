Biography Dr. Kendra Sharp is the Senior Adviser to the Provost for International Affairs at Oregon State University (OSU), the Richard and Gretchen Evans Professor of Humanitarian Engineering, and a Professor of Mechanical Engineering. In her administrative role, she provides leadership for the development and implementation of strategic initiatives in internationalization and global engagement at OSU. She also founded and directs OSUs Humanitarian Engineering Program. She believes deeply in the value of interdisciplinary education and research, and using engineering and technology for positive social impact. Through both her research and humanitarian engineering educational offerings, she collaborates with faculty, students, NGOs, and social entrepreneurs to address global issues in poverty, energy, and water through engineering design and international education. She has extensive international research and teaching experience in the Netherlands, New Zealand, India, Pakistan and Thailand. Her earlier research focused on experimental fluid mechanics, including microfluidics and biological applications thereof. She received the Edwin F. Church Medal from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers; Visiting Erskine Fellowships at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand; the OSU College of Engineering Faculty Mentoring Award; OSUs International Service Award; and an NSF CAREER award. Dr. Sharp serves on the Board of Trustees for WorldOregon and the Alumni Board for the Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
