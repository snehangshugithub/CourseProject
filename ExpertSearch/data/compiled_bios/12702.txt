His current research is dedicated to the development of novel techniques and methods to manipulate and characterize single-molecules using nanopore devices, to unravel the basic physics governing the behaviour of biological molecules and polymers in nanoconfined geometries, and ultimately to translate these discoveries into new tools for the Life sciences, medical diagnostics, or next-generation digital data storage.
