I have worked on automated reasoning for first-order logic. On the more fundamental side of things I developed calculi and implementations based on hyper tableau, first-order DPLL (Model Evolution) and Resolution. Many of them have been extended for equality reasoning and reasoning modulo built-in theories, some for non-monotonic reasoning and some for temporal-logic model checking. Applications included database schema reasoning, consistency-based diagnosis, software verification, business process analysis, and situational awareness. I am also interested in decison making under uncertaintly from a logical perspective. My focus is on automated reasoning systems based on Markov Decision Processes in combination with temporal logics, for planning and runtime monitoring purposes. This is driven by applications for situational awareness in industrial operations, such as factory floors and supply chains.
