His group has focused on the role of the immune system in hypertension, cardiac fibrosis and vascular injury and has developed various tools and systems for the mechanical characterization of biological samples ranging from local mechanical properties of geometrically complex tissues to biophysical properties of single cells. While focused primarily on cardiovascular disease, this multiscale approach has applicability to understanding biomechanical regulation of injury and disease processes in multiple tissues and organ systems. Biography Professor Bersi joined Washington University in St. Louis and McKelvey Engineering as an assistant professor in August 2020. Previously, he was a postdoctoral fellow in biomedical engineering and a member of the cardiovascular research training program at Vanderbilt University and Vanderbilt University Medical Center. He received a PhD in biomedical engineering from Yale University after completing his undergraduate work at Texas A&M University. Professor Bersi is the recipient of a Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) from the National Institutes of Health (2019).
