B.A., Mathematics and Physics, Dartmouth College, USA, 1999. Research Interests I have recently been trying to understand some of the different kinds of dynamics which can emerge in neuronal networks. To this end, Ive focused mainly on the insect olfactory system and the mammalian primary visual cortex. Ive also been developing tools for detecting various types of structure within large data sets, focusing mainly on finding biclusters within gene-expression and SNP data. Selected Publications A.V.
