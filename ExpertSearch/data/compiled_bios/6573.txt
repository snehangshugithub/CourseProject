Core to his teaching philosophy for these courses is providing an atmosphere in which students may learn incrementally, often involving recurring technical themes, from out-of-class assignments that are informed by content delivery and examples available in the classroom and online. In each class taught, course technology such as slide screen recording, Web-based assessments, and Zoom lecture/recitation delivery, has enhanced the effectiveness and availability of the course content. Courses Regularly Taught AOE 3164 - Aerothermodynamics and propulsion systems AOE/ME 4234 - Aerospace propulsion systems AOE/ME 5135 - Vehicle propulsion AOE 5154 - Data analysis in fluid dynamics Courses taught in the past AOE 6114 - Transonic aerodynamics AOE 4984 SS - Aero engine design modeling Research expertise The Vortical Flow and Diagnostics Lab specializes in experimental fluid mechanics and the development of measurement techniques for applications in propulsion and energy systems.
