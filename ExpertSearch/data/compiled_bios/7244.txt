California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA B.S. Engineering Science (Hons) University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, ILResearch InterestsDevelopment of multiscale theories, methods, and software for the design and analysis of large scale engineering material systems, materials design, manufacturing, bio-sensing, and drug delivery. PI of multi-year multi-million dollars grants from Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company to develop a virtual lab to enable prediction, synthesis, characterization, and acceleration the synthesis of new polymer nanocomposites with enhanced performance and fulfillment of AAA labeling requirements. Collaborative research is also underway with Bridgestone and Japanese Universities. Technology transfer through DMDII project Elastic Cloud-Based Make: Led by GE, NU is designing training modules for Adaptive Vehicle Make (AVM) toolsets of digital manufacturing technologies developed under the Defense Advanced Research Project Agencys (DARPA) Adaptive Vehicle Make (AVM) program, such as the instant Foundry Adaptive through Bits (iFAB) tools. The goal is to integrate the most mature elements of the digital manufacturing technologies into an existing commercially available Product Lifecycle Management, Computer-Aided Engineering or Model-Based Engineering software solution, and to apply the resulting new capability to a manufactured product. Technology transfer: Development of new methods and algorithms that have significantly enhanced the accuracy and speed in software for crashworthiness, manufacturing, and prototype simulations. These contributions have been implemented in many commercial and laboratory software: (a) Solid shell elements in DYNA3D, ABAQUS, LS-DYNA, ANSYS, and Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) software; (b) Explicit/implicit methods in US Ballistic Laboratory EPIC-2/EPIC-3 programs, and ANL software; (c) Lagrangian-Eulerian methods adopted by ANL, Kawasaki, Mitsubishi, Ford Motors, and Grumman; (d) Meshfree methods implemented by Sandia National Labs, Lawrence Livermore National Lab, General Motors, Ford Motors, Delphi, Ball Aerospace, Caterpillar, and among many others; (e) Proprietary multiscale methods adopted by Goodyear, Bridgestone for the design of tires and by Sandia. Liu has been developing theoretical and modeling and simulation methodologies that are able to connect multiscale mechanics to microstructural design parameters and for the modeling of microfluidic electrokinetic assembly of bio-molecules and drug delivery. He made fundamental, innovative contributions that have benefitted the understanding and design of additive manufacturing materials, engineering material systems, biological processes, and the use of organic and inorganic materials for drug delivery applications. Liu is elected as the President of IACM, the Chair of USNCTAM within the US National Academies, and a member of the Board of International Scientific Organization within the US National Academies. In 2014, Liu is selected as a highly cited researcher in Computer Science and a member of the Worlds Most Influential Scientific Minds by Thompson Reuters for the period 2002 through 2012. Liu chaired the ASME AMD and is a past president of USACM. He was the founding Director of the NSF Summer Institute on Nano Mechanics & Materials, Founding Chairman of the ASME NanoEngineering Council, Founding Co-Director of the NU PSED Program and Founding Director of the MS in SdX specialization ME and CEE program. He is the editor of two International Journals and honorary editor of two journals and has been a consultant for more than 20 organizations.
