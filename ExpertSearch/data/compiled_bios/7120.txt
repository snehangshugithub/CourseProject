We are particularly interested in scientific research that can inform management decisions by beekeepers, growers and the public. Current research projects include: 1) Understanding pesticide exposure and risk to bees in multiple land management contexts, 2) Combining empirical data with network modeling to understand pathogen transmission in complex plant-pollinator networks, and 3) Understanding how habitat enhancements (e.g., flowers at solar power sites) impact pollinator populations and the services they provide to agriculture. Our lab shares space with the Cornell Chemical Ecology Core Facility, where we currently operate a 260-compound multi-residue pesticide analysis via UPLC-MS/MS. We also have lab space for molecular biology (PCR, etc.), walk-in growth chamber space for rearing bees and bioassays, and off-campus space (the Dyce Lab for Honey Bee Studies) where our ~75-colony research and extension apiaries are located.Outreach and Extension FocusOur extension efforts are mainly geared towards beekeepers, growers and the public. Our main extension website is: https://pollinator.cals.cornell.edu/, and you can find us on Facebook at: https://www.facebook.com/DyceLab/ I write a monthly column in American Bee Journal, which reaches ~15,000 subscribers. Each month, I summarize a recent pollinator health paper from the primary literature for a non-scientific audience. The goal is to make the emerging pollinator health science more approachable and relevant to beekeepers: http://americanbeejournal.com/category/columns/notes-from-the-lab/ I am also a member of the New York State Beekeeper Tech Team, which works directly with NYS beekeepers to improve honey bee health, reduce colony losses, and increase profitability of the states beekeeping industry: https://pollinator.cals.cornell.edu/nys-beekeeper-tech-team/ I coordinate workshops for beekeepers and the public, such as "Introduction to Honey Bee Queen Rearing" and "Honey Bee Biology and Disease Management for Veterinarians": https://pollinator.cals.cornell.edu/resources/beekeeping-workshops I also interact extensively with growers regarding pesticide risk to bees and creating pollinator-friendly habitat. Our extension materials on this topic can be found at: https://pollinator.cals.cornell.edu/resources/grower-resources/Teaching FocusWith a 60-40 research-extension split, I have no formal teaching commitments. However, I love to teach and lead a bi-weekly 'Pollinator Reading Group' that is open to undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs and faculty. The focus of the reading group is discussion of current literature, research plans and happenings related to pollinators at Cornell and elsewhere. I also give regular guest lectures in courses such as Applied Entomology, Honey Bee Biology, and Integrated Pest Management, and I administer our pollinator list serve (POLLINATOR-L@cornell.edu).Additional LinksLaboratory Pollinator Network Dyce Lab Facebook Selected PublicationsJournal PublicationsAdler, L.
