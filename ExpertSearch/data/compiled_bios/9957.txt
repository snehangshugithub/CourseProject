Probability and Random Processes, TuTh 3:30PM - 4:59PM, Lewis 100 Biography He received his B.E. from the City College of New York in 1982, and his M.S. and Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1984 and 1993, respectively.After completing his Ph.D., Professor Ramchandran became an Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and Associate Director of the Beckman Institute Multimedia Laboratory. In the Beckman Institute, he was a member of the Image Formation and Processing Group. In 1999, he came to UC Berkeley's EECS Department and created the Berkeley Audiovisual Signal Processing and Communication Systems (BASiCS) Lab here. Professor Ramchandran is an IEEE Fellow and has been awarded the Outstanding Teaching Award by the EECS Department at UC Berkeley.
