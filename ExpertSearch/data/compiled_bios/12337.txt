(1964) and Linda R. Young Professor of Neuroscience Elly Nedivi studies the mechanisms underlying brain circuit plasticity characterizing the genes and proteins involved, as well as visualizing synaptic and neuronal remodeling in the living mouse brain. 617-253-2344 Phone 46-3239 Office nedivi@mit.edu Email Lab Website Charles Moss Assistant 617-452-2070 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1991, Stanford University BSc, 1982, Biology and Biochemistry, Hebrew University, Israel Research Summary The property of the brain that allows it to constantly adapt to change is termed plasticity, and is a prominent feature not only of learning and memory in the adult, but also of brain development. Connections between neurons (synapses) that are frequently used become stronger, while those that are unstimulated gradually dwindle away. The Nedivi lab works to identify the cellular mechanisms that underlie the addition and elimination of synaptic connections in response to activity using genetic and in vivo imaging approaches.
