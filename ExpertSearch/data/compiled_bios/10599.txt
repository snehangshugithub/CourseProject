Recently, he has been involved in projects related to 5G cellular systems; Wi-Fi protocols; millimeter wave, or mmWave,systems, includingbeam discovery, initial access, phased antenna arrays andwireless backhauling; cognitive/agile radios; dynamic and shared spectrum access; harmonious coexistence of heterogeneous wireless systems; full-duplex transmissions; ultra-low-latency mobile edge computing for vehicle-to-everything, or V2X, communication; network slicing; physical-layer wireless security; satellite communications; multiple-input multiple-output, or MIMO, systems;energy management in wireless sensor networks;and streaming over wireless links. In the past, he worked on traffic analysis, packet scheduling, multimedia communications, power control, constraint-based routing, fault detection in optical networksand other topics. Krunz has co-authored more than 290 journal articles and peer-reviewed conference papers, and is a co-inventor of several patents and invention disclosures. His latest h-index is 60 and his total number of citations exceeds 12,000. His research has been funded by the National Science Foundation; the U.S. Department of Defense, including the Army Research Office, Air Force Research Laboratory and Air Force Office of Scientific Research; NASA; the Qatar Foundation; South Korea, and several U.S. and international corporations -- with a total amount in excess of $18 million.
