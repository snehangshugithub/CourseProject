Dr. Potapenkos research interests include elasticity and composite materials. He studies the integral and functional equations of continuum mechanics, and also analyzes cosserate solids. His current research surrounds both fundamental and applied aspects of linear elasticity theories and the implementation of computational methods for the solution of boundary-value problems arising from those theories. In addition, he conducts research on traditional engineering areas such as plates and shells and on classical elasticity inclusion problems. Dr. Potapenko hires graduate students who are interested in conducting research in the areas of solid mechanics and elasticity. He also has several publications about elasticity, which is his predominant area of research.Research InterestsElasticityComposite MaterialsIntegral Equations of Continuum MechanicsFunctional Equations of Continuum MechanicsCosserat SolidsPlates and ShellsApplied mechanics and stochastic systemsStructuresMechanics & ConstructionEducation2002, Doctorate, PhD, Universitiy of Alberta2000, Master's, MSc, St. Petersburg State University1994, Bachelor's, BSc, St. Petersburg State UniversityCourses*CIVE 105 - Mechanics 2Taught in 2017CIVE 205 - Solid Mechanics 2Taught in 2018, 2019, 2021CIVE 221 - Advanced CalculusTaught in 2018, 2019CIVE 222 - Differential EquationsTaught in 2017CIVE 224 - Probability & StatisticsTaught in 2016CIVE 306 - Mechanics of Solids 3Taught in 2018, 2019CIVE 610 - ElasticityTaught in 2018, 2019, 2021ENVE 223 - Diff Equations & Bal LawsTaught in 2016GEOE 221 - Advanced CalculusTaught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsAtroshchenko, E and Potapenko, S, Weak solutions of the transmission problem in anti-plane Cosserat elasticity, ZAMM-Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics/Zeitschrift fr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik, 2015Atroshchenko, Elena and Potapenko, S and Glinka, G, Stress intensity factor for a semi-elliptical crack subjected to an arbitrary mode I loading, Mathematics and Mechanics of Solids, 19(3), 2014, 289 - 298Kapiturova, Maria and Gracie, R and Potapenko, S, Simulation of cracks in a Cosserat medium using the extended finite element method, Mathematics and Mechanics of Solids, 2014Skiba, Oxana and Gracie, Robert and Potapenko, Stanislav, Electromechanical simulations of dislocations, Modelling and Simulation in Materials Science and Engineering, 21(3), 2013Potapenko, Stanislav and Shmoylova, E, Weak solutions of the problem of torsion of micropolar elastic beams, Zeitschrift fr angewandte Mathematik und Physik, 61(3), 2010, 529 - 536Graduate StudiesCurrently considering applications from graduate students.
