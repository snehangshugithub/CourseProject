He has worked in a series of interdisciplinary research areas, including applied mathematics, computational and symbolic algebra, numerical analysis, computing in high energy physics, bioinformatics, high-performance computing, and computer systems. He has graduated 10 PhD students and has co-authored over 125 refereed publications.The ongoing DMTCP project (Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing) supports transparent checkpointing (snapshots) with no modification to the target application binary. DMTCP extends transparent checkpoint support to external hardware/software environments like GPUs and network interconnects to support MPI for HPC. Over 150 refereed publications document examples of using DMTCP.The newest direction for DMTCP is to make it a standard for supercomputing and HPC. In collaboration with the DOEs NERSC supercomputing center, the DMTCP project (including MANA for MPI and CRAC for CUDA) is being extended and validated for production use. This will be used on NERSCs Perlmutter supercomputer (expected to become the #6 supercomputer in the world when fully installed). The functionality provided by DMTCP, MANA, and CRAC will enable scientists to execute long-running computations by using checkpoint-restart to chain together multiple allocation time slots. Currently, users are limited to a maximum allocation time slot of 48 hours. This showcase project will allow other HPC centers to also use this new technology.

The lab currently includes four PhD students (one in ECE/COE and three in CS/Khoury).Transparent Checkpointing for HPC (funded by NSF, NERSC/DOE, and MemVerge) Our DMTCP platform has been extended to include MANA (checkpointing for MPI) and CRAC (checkpointing for CUDA). We are working closely with NERSC to integrate MANA into their production workload.College Research Initiatives Integrated Modeling, Inference, and Computing link Toggle Accordion Publications Selected PublicationsTwinkle Jain and Gene Cooperman, CRAC: Checkpoint-Restart Architecture for CUDA with Streams and UVM, Proc. of the Int.
