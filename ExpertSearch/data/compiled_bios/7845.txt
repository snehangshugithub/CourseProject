Eckert Professor of Engineering Applied and Engineering Physics Clark Hall, Room 252 607/255-1184 Director of CCMR frank.wise@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyWise was a member of the technical staff at Bell Laboratories before coming to Cornell. He joined the Cornell faculty in 1988, and was named an NSF Presidential Young Investigator in 1989. He has received several awards for excellence and innovation in teaching. From 2007 to 2011 he was director of the School of Applied and Engineering Physics.Research InterestsOur main research projects are listed below. Development of femtosecond-pulse lasers and amplifiers We are working to develop sources of ultrashort optical pulses that could be used in applications outside of basic research laboratories. Currently we are focused on fiber lasers and amplifiers. Our activities range from theoretical studies of new mechanisms for shaping pulses in lasers to laser engineering and commercial development. Studies of optical spatiotemporal solitons Optical solitons are packets of localized electromagnetic radiation that propagate without spreading out spatially despite diffraction nor temporally despite group-velocity dispersion. We are working to generate fully-confined spatiotemporal solitons (sometimes referred to as "light bullets").Optical Physics and Quantum Information ScienceSelected PublicationsL. G. Wright, D. N.
