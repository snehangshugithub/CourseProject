He examines these interactions to understand the conditions for building sustainable communities from local to global scales in the face of global change. David brings diverse knowledge sets together to engage in this research: systems thinking and modeling, collective action and the commons, and human behavior, among others. His research methods include mathematical and computational modeling, case study analysis, and behavioral experiments.
