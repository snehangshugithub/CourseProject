Research Interests My research focuses on evolution nonlinear partial differential equations, and more precisely on fluid mechanics and nonlinear dispersive equations. This includes in particular the equations of Navier-Stokes or Euler, water waves, as well as nonlinear Schrdinger or wave equations. These equations give rise to a great variety of questions: from existence and uniqueness of solutions, to their long time behavior or statistical description. A secondary domain of interest for me is harmonic analysis, which has deep connections with the partial differential equations just mentioned. Selected Publications P. Germain, N. Masmoudi, and J.
