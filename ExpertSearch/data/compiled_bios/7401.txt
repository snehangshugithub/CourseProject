B.S., Physics and Optics, Wuhan University, China, 1985. Research Interests My research interests lie in the field of physics of fluids and complex systems, which includes biomechanics or bio-locomotion (organismal swimming and flying, and walking), geophysical fluids (thermal convection, continental dynamics, and erosion), solid-on-solid friction, urban heat-island effect, and self-organization phenomena at different scales.
