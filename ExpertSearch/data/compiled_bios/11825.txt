In particular, a lot of focus is on high dimensional problems, reflecting requirements for diverse applications in data processing, handling biological and genetic data, risk management, channels with memory, smart grids among others.Currently I am funded by the National Science Foundation, and my latest work tries to reshape the way we think about some statistical problems. At a high level, consider the nature of scientific discovery. We keep refining theories as we see more data. The natural question therefore is---will the refinements ever end? Will it happen that at some point, we can make up our minds and say with confidence that our inference is good enough and no more data will change it substantially?There are a number of nuances to this broad perspective, and our recent publications listed below summarize some of our results.
