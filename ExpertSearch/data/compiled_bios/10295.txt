My current areas of interest are DNA mechanics and topology, protein-DNA interaction, modeling cell migration, and modeling the systemic response of human immune system to viral attack. I am also interested in nonlinear dynamics in general and the dynamics of large systems of biochemical reactions in particular, both deterministic and stochastic.
