His primary research interests are in experimental fluid dynamics and turbulence as related to flow control, aeroacoustics, fluid structure interactions and the development of low order models. He received his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Alfred University in 1989 and his MS and PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Clarkson University in 1992 and 1996 respectively. Since graduating with his doctorate he has held positions at BEAM Technologies (Research Scientist), NASA Langley Research Center (NRC Post-Doctoral Associate) and the Jamie Whitten National Center for Physical Acoustics at the University of Mississippi (Research Scientist and Research Assistant Professor) before joining the faculty at UF. Dr. Ukeiley is an active member in many professional society and has served on the Technical Committees in both the AIAA and ASME.
