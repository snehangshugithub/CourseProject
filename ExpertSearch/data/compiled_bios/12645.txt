Burr Professor of Engineering Electrical and Computer Engineering David E. Burr Professor of Engineering Materials Science and Engineering djena@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyDebdeep Jena is theRichard E. Lunquist Sesquicentennial Faculty Fellow, Professor at Cornell University where he holds a joint appointment in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.Debdeep Jena received the B. Tech. degree with a major in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur in 1998, and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) in 2003. His research and teaching interests are in the MBE growth and device applications of quantum semiconductorheterostructures (currently III-V nitride semiconductors), investigation of charge transport in nanostructured semiconducting materials such as graphene, nanowires and nanocrystals, and their device applications, and in the theory of charge, heat, and spin transport in nanomaterials. He is the author on several journal publications, including articles in Science, Physical Review Letters, and Electron Device Letters among others. He has received two best student paper awards in 2000 and 2002 for his Ph.D. dissertation research, the NSF CAREER award in 2007, and the Joyce award for excellence in undergraduate teaching in 2010.Research InterestsAdvanced MaterialsEnergy SystemsEnergy and the EnvironmentAdvanced Materials ProcessingMaterials Synthesis and ProcessingNanotechnologyNonlinear DynamicsSemiconductor Physics and DevicesSensors and ActuatorsResearch Group MembersSelected PublicationsSong, B., M.
