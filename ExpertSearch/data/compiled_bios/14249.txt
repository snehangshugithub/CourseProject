He received his Ph.D. in Computer Vision and Optical Information Processing from Laval University (Quebec City, Canada) and the National Research Council.After finishing his Ph.D., he worked on optical information processing at the University of Valencia (Spain), on superresolution laser microscopy at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and on 3D hand held scanners at Tricorder plc (London, England). Since he joined the National Research Council, he has been conducting research in the areas of computer vision, pattern recognition and computational intelligence, with a focus on content-based indexing and retrieval of images and objects. His research has been widely applied, for visualization of artefacts and architectural complexes, 3D anthropometry, shape and appearance retrieval of very large cultural heritage artefact databases and on structural proteomics and macromolecular docking. He is currently pursuing research on computational vaccinology and computer vision.
