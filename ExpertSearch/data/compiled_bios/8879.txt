Honors and Awards Chateaubriand Fellowship in Humanities and Social Science, 2013 Beckman Institute Graduate Fellowship, 2011-2012 Arnold Small Best Student Paper Award, Aging Technical Group, 2009, 2015 Biography Jessie Chin is an assistant professor in the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her research programs aim at (1) advancing knowledge in cognitive sciences regarding evolving human interaction with the contemporary information technologies, and (2) translating theories in social and behavioral sciences to the design of technologies and interaction experience to promote health communication and behavior across the lifespan.As a translational cognitive scientist, she conducts both use-inspired basic and applied research to examine the interaction between human minds and complex information environments in both individual and collective levels using mixed methods, such as experiments, user studies, field studies, social media data analysis, computational/predictive modeling and randomized control trials. Her current research projects include (1) examining cancer-related misinformation using both behavioral and computational approaches, (2) examining human decision-making with AI systems across the lifespan; and (3) building affordable and scalable socio-technical mechanisms to promote chronic illness prevention using innovative technologies for addressing health disparities. Chinearned her MS in human factors and PhD in educational psychology at the University of Illinoisat Urbana-Champaign and did her postdoctoral training in systems design engineering at the University of Waterloo. Before joining the iSchool, Chin was a faculty member in biomedical and health information sciences at the College of Applied Health Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
