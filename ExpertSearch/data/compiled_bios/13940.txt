We utilize biological insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation in order to determine the impact of disease-associated variants on cellular function. We aim to identify actionable insights into disease pathogenesis by studying the confluence of genetic and epigenetic risk factors of human diseases, including multiple sclerosis and opioid use disorder.
