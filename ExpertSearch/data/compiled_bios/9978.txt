Ma Larger Photo Eric Y. Ma Below The Line Assistant Professor Info Links Research Areas Physical Electronics (PHY) Energy (ENE) Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Biography Eric Y. Ma received his B.S. in Physics from Peking University in 2010 and his Ph.D. in Applied Physics from Stanford University in 2016. He stayed at Stanford as a joint postdoctoral scholar in Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering. He was also briefly Senior Scientist at Apple. In July 2021 Dr. Ma joined UC Berkeley full-time as Assistant Professor in Physics and by courtesy EECS, and currently holds the Georgia Lee Chair in Physics. Dr. Ma is interested in studying the interaction between electromagnetic fields and condensed matter (solids and liquids) in uncommon regimes. These include at deeply sub-wavelength scales, in radiative-decay-dominated systems, and at unconventional frequencies such as THz, mid-infrared and deep ultraviolet. He focuses on developing new tools and protocols with techniques from microwave to ultraviolet, in the form of electronics, optics, and microscopy. His research often lies at the interface between Photonics and Quantum Materials, and strikes a balance between being curiosity-driven and being inspired by more practical problems in computation, sensing, human-computer interface, and mixed reality.
