Audience Tools Search Menu Faculty > Katherine Cross Katherine Cross CV Ph.D. Student kcross1@uw.edu Specializations Online Harassment Ethics of Information and Technology Social Media/Networking and Video Games Biography I'm a PhD Student at the Information School focused on studying the dynamics of online harassment, and how we might develop ethical approaches to the problem. My current research interests also include speculative fiction and video gaming; I examine them from the perspective of an art critic while studying the fan communities that form around them, and how it can all intersect with online toxicity. I'm especially interested in developing structural frameworks for understanding harassment, and ethical approaches that are equal to contemporary technology.
