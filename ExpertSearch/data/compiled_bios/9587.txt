He was a faculty member in the Department of Economics at Harvard before returning to Stanford's economics department in 1989. Goulder's research covers a range of environmental issues, including green tax reform, the design of environmental tax systems and emissions trading policies, climate change policy, and comprehensive wealth measurement ("green" accounting). He has servedon several advisory committees to the US Environmental Protection Agencys Science Advisory Board and the California Air Resources Board, andasco-editor of theJournal of Environmental Economics and Managementand theReview of Environmental Economics and Policy.

Some of his work involves collaborations with climatologists and biologists. At Stanford Goulder teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in environmental economics and policy, and co-organizes weekly seminars in public and environmental economics.
