He is a founder of illumiSonics Inc., where he held the position of CEO from 2014 to 2018; he remains the CTO and Chairman of the Board, where he leads all scientific research and technology development and oversees major company decisions and policies. illumiSonics under Dr. Haji Reza's leadership raised private investments (+$7M) and attracted notable individuals and international companies. Dr. Haji Reza Joined the University of Waterloo in April 2018 as an assistant professor in biomedical engineering. He received the Faculty of Engineering Distinguished Performance Award (2020) and Engineering Research Excellence Award (2021). In 2021, for the work he has done to support the mental health of the students, he received the Engineering Society Friend of Natalie Award. He has established PhotoMedicine Labs at the University of Waterloo (2019), which has attracted, trained, and retained top biomedical engineering students from across Canada and internationally. PhotoMedicine Labs is funded by industry collaborators and top granting agencies in Canada (e.g., New Frontiers Exploration grant) and has garnered ~$3M in its first three years (with ~1M expected annually in the next five years). Dr. Reza s current research focuses on developing the first real-time cancer surgical microscope to enable immediate tissue biopsy and full tumour resection during surgery, as well as the first clinical ophthalmic imaging tool capable of pre-diagnosing eye-blinding diseases before they become symptomatic (this is not currently possible). Since 2019, the lab has published numerous high-impact peer-reviewed articles, reporting breakthroughs in histological, oncological, ophthalmological and endoscopic imaging that could revolutionize the way the world looks at tissues. In general, Dr. Haji Reza and his team are interested in designing and developing novel hardware and software methods for clinical and pre-clinical biomedical applications. These new technologies aim to provide clinicians and researchers with novel capabilities and information that is presently difficult to obtain with existing techniques. He invented and pioneered several new technologies/concepts including, Photoacoustic Remote Sensing (PARS) microscopy, a novel absorption-based, non-contact, non-invasive, label-free imaging technique. Dr. Haji Reza and his team continually strive to maintain an extremely dynamic, respectful, intellectual, fun, and creative environment. The team is working on cutting-edge research in biomedical engineering and biophotonics, including non-invasive non-contact optical imaging methods, micro-endoscopy designs, handheld, and portable medical imaging techniques, design, and fabrication of nano-structured sensors, image processing, Machine Learning methods, Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers, and novel deep optical imaging tomography methods. The team pursues applications in ophthalmology, oncology, dermatology, neurology, cardiology, dentistry, pharmaceutical, and pre-clinical research. The research philosophy of PhotoMedicine labs is transitional research from bench to the bedside. We are always looking to collaborate with talented students, faculties, researchers, clinicians, and industry.Research InterestsMedical imagingImage processingMachine learningMedical devicesNano-fabricationPhotoacoustic remote sensing (PARS) microscopyCapacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT)Multi-scale functional and molecular photoacoustic tomographyUltrasound imagingAll optical and non-contact detection systemsPhotoacoustic wavefront shapingOptical coherence tomography (OCT)Multi-photon microscopyNovel multi-modality optical imaging techniquesDesign and fabrication of micro-endoscopy systemsSuper-resolution imaging techniquesReal-time and 3D biomedical imagingNovel optical and fiber-based componentsNovel laser systems for biomedical applicationsOptical sensorsBiomedical Engineering OpticsPhotonicsEducation2015, Doctorate, Biomedical Engineering, University of Alberta2010, Bachelor's, (Honors) Electronics Majoring in Optical Engineering, Multimedia UniversityCourses*BME 302 - SeminarTaught in 2019BME 364 - Eng.
