He is tenured with the departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Physics, Materials Science and Engineering, and Bio-Engineering, as well as Carle Illinois College of Medicine. At the UIUC he established the Integrated Neurotechnology lab devoted to development of advanced engineering approaches aimed at reverse engineering of the brain circuits. The major themes include development of silicon-based nanofluidic and nanophotonic neural probes, in-vivo neurobiological experiments with massive recording and manipulation of brain activity, and, lastly, development of machine-learning algorithms to analyze large neural datasets. Prior to joining the UIUC in 2016, Dr. Vlasov held various research and managerial positions at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in N.Y. where he led broad company-wide efforts in integrated silicon nanophotonics and more recently in neuromorphic computing architectures. He initiated the Silicon Nanophotonics project in 2001 and managed it for over 15 years from its early fundamental research stage up to commercial manufacturing of optical transceivers for large-scale datacenters and supercomputers. The technology has been fully qualified and deployed for commercial production at GlobalFoundries. Prior to joining IBM in 2001, Dr. Vlasov developed semiconductor nanophotonics at the N.E.C. Research Institute in Princeton, N.J. and at the Strasbourg IPCMS Institute in France. For over a decade, he was also a Research Scientist with the Ioffe Institute of Physics and Technology in St. Petersburg, Russia working on optics of nanostructured semiconductors. He received his M.S. from the University of St. Petersburg (1988) and Ph.D from the Ioffe Institute (1994), both in physics. Dr. Vlasov is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a Fellow of the APS, the IEEE, and the OSA. He has published over 300 papers, filed over 100 patents, and delivered over 100 invited, plenary and tutorial talks. He received the IBM CEO Corporate Award, the Best of IBM Award, and several IBM Outstanding Technical Achievement Awards, as well as was named Scientist of the Year by the Scientific American journal. Dr. Vlasov and his work has been covered in numerous major newspapers, including New York Times, Forbes, Wall Street Journal, and others. It has been featured on television news programs including The Tonight Show, ABC, CBS, etc. It has also been highlighted in review columns on Science Daily, Scientific American Journal, New Scientist, etc. Academic Positions 2021- current, John Bardeen Endowed Chair, Electrical Engineering and Physics, UIUC 2016 - 2021, Grainger Engineering Breakthrough Initiative (GEBI) Founder Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering, UIUC 2016 - current, Inaugural Professor, Clinical Neuroscience, Carle Illinois College of Medicine, UIUC 2016 - current, Professor, Department of BioEngineering, UIUC 2016 - current , Neurotechnology for Memory and Cognition, Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, UIUC 2016 - current, Professor, Neuroscience Program, UIUC 2016 - current, Professor, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, UIUC 2016 - current, Holonyak Micro and Nano Technology Laboratory, UIUC 2007-2008, Adjunct Professor, ECE Department, Columbia University Other Professional Employment 2015-2016 Manager, Department of Brain-Inspired Technologies, IBM TJ Watson Research Center, NY 2013- 2014 Visiting Scientist, HHMI Janelia Farm Research Campus, VA 2008- 2013 Manager,Department of Silicon Integrated Nanophotonics, IBM TJ Watson Research Center, NY 2001-2008 Project Lead, Silicon Nanophotonics, IBM TJ Watson Research Center, NY 2000-2001 Scientist, NEC Research Institute, Inc., Princeton NJ 1998-2000 Postdoctoral Member of Staff, NEC Research Institute, Inc., Princeton NJ 1996-1997 Postdoctoral Fellow, Strasbourg Institute of Materials Physics, France 1994-2000 Research Scientist, Ioffe Institute of Physics and Technology, Russia 1988-1994 Junior Research Scientist, Ioffe Institute of Physics and Technology, Russia Major Consulting Activities 2015-2018 Senior Fellow , Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, VA Professional Registrations NAE Member 2021 IEEE Fellow 2015 APS Fellow 2007 OSA Fellow 2006 Professional Highlights National Academy of Engineering.

Our vision is to integrate engineering, systems neuroscience, and data analytics to advance our knowledge of inner working of the brain. Correspondingly, the interdisciplinary projects in the lab can be categorized into three main threads: Neuro-engineering, Neuro-biology, and Neuro-informatics. Neuro-engineering is focused on developing advanced neural probes to interrogate and manipulate the brain using nanotechnology approaches. These novel tools are used in Neuro-biology experiments to record massive datasets of brain activity in live animals during active navigation in virtual reality. Development of machine learning analytical methods in Neuro-informatics thread provides insight into functionality of neural circuits and systems.
