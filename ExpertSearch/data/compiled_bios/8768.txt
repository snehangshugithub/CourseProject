Researchers including Professor Gang Chen are developing a variety of window technologies that could prevent this massive loss of energy. READ MORE A materials insulating properties can be tuned at will A team of researchers at MIT including Professor Gang Chen have designed a long-sought device, which they refer to as an electrical heat valve, that can vary the thermal conductivity on demand. READ MORE Getting more heat out of sunlight A new transparent material developed by Professors Evelyn Wang and Gang Chen lets sunlight pass through easily but blocks solar heat from escaping. The material could be used for home heating or for industrial processes.
