He is one of the pioneers in understanding the morphology and composition of particulate wear debris in total hip and total knee replacements. He has developed many in-vitro and in-vivo models to understand the biological response to wear debris. Dr. Shanbhags team also evaluated potential therapeutic agents to reverse the deleterious inflammatory response to wear debris. Currently, Dr. Shanbhag is evaluating digital technologies to develop robust vaccination records amongst the rural poor and migrant communities. These studies are supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Dr. Shanbhag organizes numerous Ideation Competitions and Hackathons to inspire students to innovate and develop a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship.
