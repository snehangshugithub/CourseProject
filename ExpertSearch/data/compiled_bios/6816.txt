After graduation she worked as a visiting scientist with the National Institute of Aerospace at NASA Langley Research Center and joined the University of Virginia as an assistant professor in2018. Dedic is an active member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), and serves on the AIAA Technical Committee on Aerodynamic Measurement Technology.She is also currently serving as the UVA MAE Director for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Professor Dedics research interests are centered around the development and application of advanced laser-based diagnostics and nonlinear spectroscopy techniques to study nonequilibrium, reacting, and multiphase flow environments with the goal of furthering the development of technologies related to clean energy and hypersonic propulsion and aerodynamics. In particular, Dedic is interested in applying complex laser measurements to study harsh environments while emphasizing measurement accuracy and spatial and temporal resolution.Her expertise includes the development of advanced laser diagnosticsin particular femtosecond/picosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (fs/ps CARS)and deployment in challenging flows characterized by extreme pressures, shock waves, large temperature gradients, transient flow dynamics, and nonthermal energy distributions. Applications include nonequilibrium flows, supersonic combustion, atmospheric entry, detonations, and renewable energy.
