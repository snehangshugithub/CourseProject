University of Virginia, 1976Ph.D. University of Virginia, 1980 "Our laboratory designs novel spinal cord stimulator devices, and systems for treating irregular heartbeat." George T. Gillies, Research Professor George T. Gillies received the B.Sc. degree in physics from North Dakota State University, Fargo, in 1974. He then received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in engineering physics in 1976 and 1980 from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, where he is currently a Research Professor of mechanical and biomedical engineering in the School of Engineering and Applied Science. He was formerly with the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, Sevres, France, and at the U.S. Department of Energys Oak Ridge Complex. His current research interests include medical device development, clinical magnetic manipulation systems, and precision measurement technology. He has authored or co-authored over 300 publications and holds over 30 U.S. Patents. He is the co-inventor of the EpiAccess system for obtaining minimally invasive pericardial access. It is a part of the Epicardial Tool Kit, which is licensed by UVA for commercial development. His is also a co-inventor of the I-Patch intradural spinal cord stimulator system, which is also licensed by UVA for commercial development.
