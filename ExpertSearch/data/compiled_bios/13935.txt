King Professor of Biology Emeritus Before closing his lab, Jonathan A. King studied what happens when proteins do not fold properly leading to conditions like cataracts. He currently works to protect the conditions needed to support biomedical research. 617-253-4700 Phone 68-223b Office jaking@mit.edu Email Lab Website Cindy Woolley Assistant 617-253-6060 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1968, California Institute of Technology SB, 1962, Zoology, Yale University Research Summary After decades of investigating protein folding, misfolding and aggregation, and bacteriophage structure and assembly, I am now concentrating on protecting the conditions needed to support biomedical research, in particular federal investment in biomedical research through the NIH and NSF budgets. This involves not only advocating for these investments, but critiquing the enormous drain on productive investment of our tax dollars through excessive military spending, particularly on nuclear weapons. To this end I chair the Reducing the Threat of Nuclear War Conference held annually in the Spring at MIT, and chair the Nuclear Disarmament Working Group of Mass Peace Action which provides national leadership on nuclear disarmament.
