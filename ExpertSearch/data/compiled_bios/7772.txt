He spent the ensuing 15 years at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley, where he was the chair of the accounting group for seven years. While at Haas, he established the Center for Financial Reporting and Management, was its first faculty director, and received an award for excellence in teaching in the MBA program and an Honorable Mention for Evening MBA teaching. He rejoined the UCLA Anderson faculty in 2003 and is currently chair of the accounting area here and serves on the Universitys Council on Academic Personnel, a campus-wide committee that reviews cases for tenure and promotion. Trueman works extensively with doctoral students. Students whose dissertation committees he has chaired have been placed at top schools, including Columbia University, Wharton, Yale, UC Berkeley, London Business School, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Southern Methodist University. Trueman won the Dean's Award for Exceptional Mentorship of Doctoral Students in 2015. Trueman has published widely in accounting and finance journals. He is a member of the editorial boards of the Journal of Investment Management and the Journal of Accounting and Public Policy. He is a former associate editor of The Accounting Review and was previously on the editorial boards of the Financial Analysts Journal, Contemporary Accounting Research, and the Journal of Accounting, Auditing and Finance. He has also authored a financial accounting primer, a self-guided, interactive online course designed for incoming MBA students. During his academic career, Trueman has also served as an expert witness on cases related to the quality of security analysts research reports and the valuation of high-tech companies. His expertise has been cited in national and international media, including the Associated Press, Business Week, the New York Times, CBS MarketWatch Fortune, Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal. At UCLA Anderson, Trueman has taught the core financial accounting course to MBA and FEMBA students, as well as an elective in corporate finance reporting.
