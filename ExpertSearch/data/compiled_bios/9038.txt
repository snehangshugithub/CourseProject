Previously, he was a tenured Associate Professor and Director of Graduate Studies in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University at Buffalo (UB), The State University of New York. His area of research is on experimental wireless networking and mobile computing, with a current focus on millimeter wave networking, high-bandwidth applications (VR, 360o video streaming) over 5G networks, energy-aware protocol design for smartphones, and wireless sensing. In these areas, he has published over 80 technical papers, in the most impactful conferences (e.g., ACM MobiCom, ACM MobiHoc, IEEE INFOCOM) and journals (e.g., IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, IEEE JSAC). He has received an IEEE Region 1 Technological Innovation (Academic) Award in 2019, the NSF CAREER Award in 2016, three best paper awards, and multiple research and teaching awards at UB. He currently serves on the editorial board of IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing and IEEE Networking Letters.EducationPhD, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, 2010Honors & AwardsACM mmNets Best Paper Award 2019IEEE Region 1 Technological Innovation (Academic) Award, September 2019UB Teaching Innovation Award, June 2018Best Paper Award, IEEE WCNC 2017UB SEAS Senior Teacher of the Year Award, December 2017NSF CAREER Award, 2016UB SEAS Early Career Researcher of the Year Award, November 2015Best Paper Award, SENSORCOMM 2007Professional AffiliationsACM (Senior Member)IEEE (Senior Member)IEEE Computer SocietyIEEE Communications SocietyUSENIX Toggle Accordion Research Research OverviewExperimental wireless networking and mobile computing, with a current focus on millimeter wave networking, high-bandwidth applications (VR, 360 video streaming) over wireless networks, LTE/WiFi coexistence, energy-aware protocol design for smartphones, and wireless sensingNU Wireless Networking and Systems LabWe conduct research in the broad areas of experimental wireless networking and mobile computing, including high performance/energy efficient protocol design and implementation, testbed prototyping, and measurement-based performance characterization. Our current focus is on millimeter wave networking, LTE/WiFi coexistence, energy-aware protocol design for smartphones, and novel RF applications. We are interested in practical problems accross different layers of the network stack (MAC, routing, transport, and applications), as well as in cross-layer interactions.
