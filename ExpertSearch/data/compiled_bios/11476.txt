He also specializes in the theory and applications of wave scattering with emphasis on methods for detecting submerged and buried objects. Such algorithms are used in sonar systems, optical and electron microscopy, spectroscopy, radiography, and ultrasonics. Other areas of study include molecular dynamics and structural dynamics pertaining to flexible structures suitable for space habitation. Publications A complete list of publications by year.
