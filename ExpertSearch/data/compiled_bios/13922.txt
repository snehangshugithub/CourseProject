Martin studies molecular mechanisms that underlie tissue form and function. 617-324-0074 Phone 68-459 Office acmartin@mit.edu Email Lab Website Meg Rheault Assistant 617-253-1809 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 2006, University of California, Berkeley BS, 2000, Biology and Genetics, Cornell University Research Summary We study how cells and tissues change shape during embryonic development, giving rise to different body parts. We visualize these changes to determine how mechanical forces drive massive tissue movements in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, we also study the regulation of tissue integrity, investigating the processes that regulate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition or EMT.
