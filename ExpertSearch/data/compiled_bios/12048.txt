People Dr Delaram Jarchi People Dr Delaram Jarchi Lecturer School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CSEE) Email delaram.jarchi@essex.ac.uk Location 5B.534, Colchester Campus Academic support hours Thursday at 4pm (zoom: 7959597720) Profile Teaching and supervision Publications Contact Profile Teaching and supervision Publications Contact Profile Biography Delaram is a Lecturer in AI and machine learning at CSEE. She received her PhD degree in Biomedical Engineering from University of Surrey in 2011. Following completion of the PhD study, she joined the Body Sensor Network group, at the Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery, Imperial College London. Her research was on wearable sensors for gait analysis applications. Before starting an academic position, she was part of the Computational Health Informatics Lab at University of Oxford and a research member of Wolfson College Oxford. Her research on accelerometry based analysis of respiratory rate has been filed as a patent application with Oxford University Innovation Ltd and being licensed. Her recent research is focused on designing new algorithms and validation of commercial wearable sensors for robust estimation of physiological parameters such as heart rate, respiratory rate and blood oxygen saturation level in very unobtrusive ways. The objective of her research is to develop the next generation of smart wearables suitable for use in clinical settings. Her research is published in various IEEE journals. She is a senior member of IEEE and an associate member of the Bio Imaging and Signal Processing (BISP) technical committee, IEEE Signal Processing Society. She is an active reviewer for various conferences and journals such as ICASSP, IEEE-JBHI (one of the 2014 best reviewers) and Sensors. She is the second author of the Body Sensor Networks & Algorithm Design book; an imprint of John Wiley & Sons Ltd to be published in 2020.
