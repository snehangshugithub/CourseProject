Winslow (1937) Career Development Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Core Faculty, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Principal Investigator, Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems Email cathywu@mit.edu Faculties Resilient Systems & Mobility Address MIT 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA, 02139 Research Website https://wucathy.com/EducationUC Berkeley, EECS, Ph.D., 2018MIT, EECS, M.Eng., 2013MIT, EECS, B.S., 2012Research InterestsCathy works at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and large-scale societal systems. Her recent research focuses on mixed autonomy systems in mobility, which studies the complex integration of automation such as self-driving cars into existing urban systems. She is interested in developing principled computational tools to enable reliable and complex decision-making for critical societal systems.Throughout her career, Cathy has collaborated and worked broadly across fields, including transportation, computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, urban planning, and public policy, and institutions, including Microsoft Research, OpenAI, the Google X Self-Driving Car Team, AT&T, Caltrans, Facebook, and Dropbox. As the founder and Chair of the Interdisciplinary Research Initiative within the ACM Future of Computing Academy, she is actively building international programs to unlock the potential of interdisciplinary research in computing.Awards and HonorsCUTC Milton Pikarsky Memorial Dissertation Award (2018)Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award, UC Berkeley (2018)ACM Future of Computing Academy, Interdisciplinary Research Initiative, Chair (2017)ITS Outstanding Graduate Student Award, UC Berkeley (2017)IEEE Best Paper Award, Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC) (2016)Rising Stars Workshop (2016)Dwight David Eisenhower Graduate Fellowship (2015)National Defense Science and Engineering (NDSEG) Graduate Fellowship (2013)National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Fellowship, Fellow (2013)Chancellors Fellowship for Graduate Study, UC Berkeley (2013)Selected PublicationsC.
