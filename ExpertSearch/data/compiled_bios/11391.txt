The algorithms for solving the home automation scheduling problems focus on eliciting homeowners' preferences and constraints regarding their utilization of smart devices as exhaustive elicitation is not feasible. In such systems, smart devices need to be scheduled in an efficient manner such that some objectives are optimized while satisfying homeowners' preferences and constraints. Some of these objectives include minimizing the monetary cost to the homeowner and minimizing the peak power demand.
