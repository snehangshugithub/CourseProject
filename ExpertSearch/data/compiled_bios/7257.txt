Technology(MIT),Cambridge, Massachusetts S.M. in Chemistry,Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT),Cambridge, Massachusetts B.S. in Physics,University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX B.A. in Chemistry, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TXResearch InterestsWe seek to understand and exploit interesting characteristics of 'soft' materials, such as polymers, liquid crystals, and biological tissues as well as hybrid combinations of them with unusual classes of micro/nanomaterials, in the form of ribbons, wires, membranes, tubes or related. Our aim is to control and induce novel electronic and photonic responses in these materials; we also develop new 'soft lithographic' and biomimetic approaches for patterning them and guiding their growth. This work combines fundamental studies with forward-looking engineering efforts in a way that promotes positive feedback between the two. Our current research focuses on soft materials for conformal electronics, nanophotonic structures, microfluidic devices, and microelectromechanical systems, all lately with an emphasis on bio-inspired and bio-integrated technologies. These efforts are highly multidisciplinary, and combine expertise from nearly every traditional field of technical study.Significant RecognitionMacArthur Fellow from the MacArthur Foundation (2009)MIT-Lemelson Award (2010)Benjamin Franklin Award from the Franklin Institute (2019)National Academy of Engineering (2010)National Academy of Science (2015)American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2014)MRS Medal from the Materials Research Society (2018)MRS Mid-Career Award from the Materials Research Society (2013)Leo Hendrick Baekland Award from the American Chemical Society (2007)A.C.
