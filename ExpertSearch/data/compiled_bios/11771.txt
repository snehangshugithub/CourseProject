She is currently an Assistant Professor in the Building Technology Program, where she leads the Digital Structures research group and co-directs the Structural Design Lab.As a researcher, Mueller focuses on developing new computational methods and tools for synthesizing architectural and structural intentions in early-stage design. She also works in the field of digital fabrication, with a focus on linking high structural performance with new methods of architectural making. In addition to her digital work, she conducts research on the nature of collaboration between architects and engineers from a historical perspective. Mueller also aims for interdisciplinary learning and integration in her teaching efforts, which include subjects in structural design and computational methods.Subscribe to our newsletter Email* PhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
