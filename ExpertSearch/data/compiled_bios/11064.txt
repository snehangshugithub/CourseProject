In particular, he seeks to explore; qualitatively...the relation between the microscopic interactions between electrons and the effective parameters that control the macroscopic behavior of solids.Current areas of Focus:- theory of quantum liquid crystalline phases of highly correlated electronic fluids- intertwined orders and the theory of high temperature superconductivity- theory of spin liquids and other fractionalized quantum phases- theory of the glass transition in super cool liquids Academic Appointments Professor, Physics Principal Investigator, Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Sciences Administrative Appointments Editor in Chief, Nature Partner Journal Quantum Materials (2016 - Present) Prabhu Goel Family Professor of Physics, Stanford University (2012 - Present) Professor, Physics, Stanford University (2004 - Present) Professor, Physics and Astronomy, UCLA (1988 - 2004) Professor of Physics, State University of New York at Stony Brook (1988 - 1989) Associate Professor of Physics, State University of New York at Stony Brook (1986 - 1988) Assistant Professor of Physics, State University of New York (1982 - 1986) Professional Education Ph.D., Harvard University, Physics (1979) Contact Academic Kivelson@stanford.edu University - Faculty Department:&nbspPhysics Position:Prabhu Goel Family Professor Department of Physics Stanford, California 94305 Administrative Contact Noelle Rudolph nrudolph@stanford.edu Additional Info Mail Code: 4045 SUNet ID(s): kivelson Links Defining "Emergence" in Physics Understanding Complexity Kivelson Group Web Link 2021-22 Courses Mathematical Methods for PhysicsPHYSICS 112 (Win) Partial Differential Equations of Mathematical PhysicsPHYSICS 111 (Aut) Independent Studies (2) Curricular Practical TrainingPHYSICS 291 (Sum) ResearchPHYSICS 490 (Aut, Win, Spr, Sum) Prior Year Courses 2020-21 Courses Condensed Matter SeminarAPPPHYS 470 (Aut, Win, Spr) Partial Differential Equations of Mathematical PhysicsPHYSICS 111 (Aut) Topics in Modern Condensed Matter Theory II: Open Problems in the theory of metals & superconductorPHYSICS 471 (Win) 2019-20 Courses Condensed Matter Theory IPHYSICS 372 (Win) Partial Differential Equations of Mathematical PhysicsPHYSICS 111 (Aut) 2018-19 Courses Advanced MechanicsPHYSICS 110, PHYSICS 210 (Aut) Thermodynamics, Kinetic Theory, and Statistical Mechanics IIPHYSICS 171 (Win) Stanford Advisees Doctoral Dissertation Reader (AC) Jack Jiang, Erik Kountz, Sam Mumford, Matthew Sorensen, Ta Tang, Bai Yang Wang, Jiachen Yu, Xinyang Zhang, xuxin huang Doctoral Dissertation Advisor (AC) Vladimir Calvera, Caleb Cook, Yuval Gannot, Zhaoyu Han, Kyung-Su Kim, Chao Wang, Yue YU, Andrew Yuan All Publications Nematic antiferromagnetism and deconfined criticality from the interplay between electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions PHYSICAL REVIEW B Wang, C., Schattner, Y., Kivelson, S.

Science (New York, N.Y.) Worasaran, T., Ikeda, M. S., Palmstrom, J. C., Straquadine, J. A., Kivelson, S. A., Fisher, I. R. 2021; 372 (6545): 973-977 Abstract Quantum criticality may be essential to understanding a wide range of exotic electronic behavior; however, conclusive evidence of quantum critical fluctuations has been elusive in many materials of current interest. An expected characteristic feature of quantum criticality is power-law behavior of thermodynamic quantities as a function of a nonthermal tuning parameter close to the quantum critical point (QCP). Here, we observed power-law behavior of the critical temperature of the coupled nematic/structural phase transition as a function of uniaxial stress in a representative family of iron-based superconductors, providing direct evidence of quantum critical nematic fluctuations in this material. These quantum critical fluctuations are not confined within a narrow regime around the QCP but rather extend over a wide range of temperatures and compositions.

We find all sorts of interesting phases including a pair-density wave, a charge 4e (and even a charge 6e) superconductor, regimes of phase separation, and a variety of distinct charge-density-wave, spin-density-wave, and superconducting regimes. We chart the crossovers that occur as a function of the degree of retardation, i.e., the ratio of characteristic phonon frequency to the strength of interactions.

Y., Kivelson, S. A., Sun, X. Q. 2020; 124 (16): 167601 Abstract In the context of recent experimental observations of an unexpectedly large thermal Hall conductivity, _{H}, in insulating La_{2}CuO_{4} (LCO) and SrTiO_{3} (STO), we theoretically explore conditions under which acoustic phonons can give rise to such a large _{H}. Both the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to _{H} are large in proportion to the dielectric constant, , and the "flexoelectric" coupling, F. While the intrinsic contribution is still orders of magnitude smaller than the observed effect, an extrinsic contribution proportional to the phonon mean-free path appears likely to account for the observations, at least in STO. We predict a larger intrinsic _{H} in certain insulating perovskites.

V., Rosenberg, E. W., Hristov, A. T., Berg, E., Fernandes, R. M., Fisher, I. R., Kivelson, S. A. 2017; 114 (51): 1343034 Abstract The paradigmatic example of a continuous quantum phase transition is the transverse field Ising ferromagnet. In contrast to classical critical systems, whose properties depend only on symmetry and the dimension of space, the nature of a quantum phase transition also depends on the dynamics. In the transverse field Ising model, the order parameter is not conserved, and increasing the transverse field enhances quantum fluctuations until they become strong enough to restore the symmetry of the ground state. Ising pseudospins can represent the order parameter of any system with a twofold degenerate broken-symmetry phase, including electronic nematic order associated with spontaneous point-group symmetry breaking. Here, we show for the representative example of orbital-nematic ordering of a non-Kramers doublet that an orthogonal strain or a perpendicular magnetic field plays the role of the transverse field, thereby providing a practical route for tuning appropriate materials to a quantum critical point. While the transverse fields are conjugate to seemingly unrelated order parameters, their nontrivial commutation relations with the nematic order parameter, which can be represented by a Berry-phase term in an effective field theory, intrinsically intertwine the different order parameters.

A. 2017; 114 (19): 4905-4910 Abstract Using determinantal quantum Monte Carlo, we compute the properties of a lattice model with spin [Formula: see text] itinerant electrons tuned through a quantum phase transition to an Ising nematic phase. The nematic fluctuations induce superconductivity with a broad dome in the superconducting [Formula: see text] enclosing the nematic quantum critical point. For temperatures above [Formula: see text], we see strikingly non-Fermi liquid behavior, including a "nodal-antinodal dichotomy" reminiscent of that seen in several transition metal oxides. In addition, the critical fluctuations have a strong effect on the low-frequency optical conductivity, resulting in behavior consistent with "bad metal" phenomenology.

A., Kao, C., Zhu, D., Lee, J. 2016; 113 (51): 14645-14650 Abstract The existence of charge-density-wave (CDW) correlations in cuprate superconductors has now been established. However, the nature of the CDW ground state has remained uncertain because disorder and the presence of superconductivity typically limit the CDW correlation lengths to only a dozen unit cells or less. Here we explore the field-induced 3D CDW correlations in extremely pure detwinned crystals of YBa2Cu3O2 (YBCO) ortho-II and ortho-VIII at magnetic fields in excess of the resistive upper critical field ([Formula: see text]) where superconductivity is heavily suppressed. We observe that the 3D CDW is unidirectional and possesses a long in-plane correlation length as well as significant correlations between neighboring CuO2 planes. It is significant that we observe only a single sharply defined transition at a critical field proportional to [Formula: see text], given that the field range used in this investigation overlaps with other high-field experiments including quantum oscillation measurements. The correlation volume is at least two to three orders of magnitude larger than that of the zero-field CDW. This is by far the largest CDW correlation volume observed in any cuprate crystal and so is presumably representative of the high-field ground state of an "ideal" disorder-free cuprate.

C., Kivelson, S. A., Fisher, I. R. 2016; 352 (6288): 958-962 Abstract A key actor in the conventional theory of superconductivity is the induced interaction between electrons mediated by the exchange of virtual collective fluctuations (phonons in the case of conventional s-wave superconductors). Other collective modes that can play the same role, especially spin fluctuations, have been widely discussed in the context of high-temperature and heavy Fermion superconductors. The strength of such collective fluctuations is measured by the associated susceptibility. Here we use differential elastoresistance measurements from five optimally doped iron-based superconductors to show that divergent nematic susceptibility appears to be a generic feature in the optimal doping regime of these materials. This observation motivates consideration of the effects of nematic fluctuations on the superconducting pairing interaction in this family of compounds and possibly beyond.

P., Steiner, M. A., Kivelson, S. A., Kapitulnik, A. 2016; 113 (2): 280-285 Abstract We combine measurements of the longitudinal (xx) and Hall (xy) resistivities of disordered 2D amorphous indium-oxide films to study the magnetic-field tuned superconductor-to-insulator transition (H-SIT) in the T --> 0 limit. At the critical field, Hc, the full resistivity tensor is T independent with xx(Hc) = h/4e(2) and xy(Hc) = 0 within experimental uncertainty in all films (i.e., these appear to be "universal" values); this is strongly suggestive that there is a particle-vortex self-duality at H = Hc. The transition separates the (presumably) superconducting state at H < Hc from a "Hall-insulator" phase in which xx --> as T --> 0 whereas xy approaches a nonzero value smaller than its "classical value" H/nec; i.e., 0 < xy < H/nec. A still higher characteristic magnetic field, Hc* > Hc, at which the Hall resistance is T independent and roughly equal to its classical value, xy H/nec, marks an additional crossover to a high-field regime (probably to a Fermi insulator) in which xy > H/nec and possibly diverges as T --> 0. We also highlight a profound analogy between the H-SIT and quantum-Hall liquid-to-insulator transitions (QHIT).

A., Kapitulnik, A. n. 2016; 113 (2): 28085 Abstract We combine measurements of the longitudinal (xx) and Hall (xy) resistivities of disordered 2D amorphous indium-oxide films to study the magnetic-field tuned superconductor-to-insulator transition (H-SIT) in the T --> 0 limit. At the critical field, Hc, the full resistivity tensor is T independent with xx(Hc) = h/4e(2) and xy(Hc) = 0 within experimental uncertainty in all films (i.e., these appear to be "universal" values); this is strongly suggestive that there is a particle-vortex self-duality at H = Hc. The transition separates the (presumably) superconducting state at H < Hc from a "Hall-insulator" phase in which xx --> as T --> 0 whereas xy approaches a nonzero value smaller than its "classical value" H/nec; i.e., 0 < xy < H/nec. A still higher characteristic magnetic field, Hc* > Hc, at which the Hall resistance is T independent and roughly equal to its classical value, xy H/nec, marks an additional crossover to a high-field regime (probably to a Fermi insulator) in which xy > H/nec and possibly diverges as T --> 0. We also highlight a profound analogy between the H-SIT and quantum-Hall liquid-to-insulator transitions (QHIT).

A., Liang, R., Hardy, W. N., Islam, Z., Mehta, A., Song, S., Sikorski, M., Stefanescu, D., Feng, Y., Kivelson, S. A., Devereaux, T. P., Shen, Z., Kao, C., Lee, W., Zhu, D., Lee, J. 2015; 350 (6263): 949-952 Abstract Charge density wave (CDW) correlations have been shown to universally exist in cuprate superconductors. However, their nature at high fields inferred from nuclear magnetic resonance is distinct from that measured with x-ray scattering at zero and low fields. We combined a pulsed magnet with an x-ray free-electron laser to characterize the CDW in YBa2Cu3O6.67 via x-ray scattering in fields of up to 28 tesla. While the zero-field CDW order, which develops at temperatures below ~150 kelvin, is essentially two dimensional, at lower temperature and beyond 15 tesla, another three-dimensionally ordered CDW emerges. The field-induced CDW appears around the zero-field superconducting transition temperature; in contrast, the incommensurate in-plane ordering vector is field-independent. This implies that the two forms of CDW and high-temperature superconductivity are intimately linked.

A. 2015; 114 (9) Abstract We consider a low T_{c} metallic superconductor weakly coupled to the soft fluctuations associated with proximity to a nematic quantum critical point (NQCP). We show that (1)a BCS-Eliashberg treatment remains valid outside of a parametrically narrow interval about the NQCP, (2)the symmetry of the superconducting state (d wave, s wave, p wave) is typically determined by the noncritical interactions, but T_{c} is enhanced by the nematic fluctuations in all channels, and (3)in 2D, this enhancement grows upon approach to criticality up to the point at which the weak coupling approach breaks down, but in 3D, the enhancement is much weaker.

In the almost three decades since, much has been learned about the novel forms of quantum matter that are exhibited in these strongly correlated electron systems. A qualitative understanding of the nature of the superconducting state itself has been achieved. However, unresolved issues include the astonishing complexity of the phase diagram, the unprecedented prominence of various forms of collective fluctuations, and the simplicity and insensitivity to material details of the 'normal' state at elevated temperatures.

In a QSL, electron spins collectively form a highly entangled quantum state that gives rise to the fractionalization of spin, charge, and statistics. We show that certain QSLs host distinct, topologically robust boundary types, some of which allow the electron to coherently enter the QSL as a fractionalized quasi-particle, leaving its spin, charge, or statistics behind.

A. 2014; 111 (22): 7980-7985 Abstract The cuprate high-temperature superconductors have been the focus of unprecedentedly intense and sustained study not only because of their high superconducting transition temperatures, but also because they represent the most exquisitely investigated examples of highly correlated electronic materials. In particular, the pseudogap regime of the phase diagram exhibits a variety of mysterious emergent behaviors. In the last few years, evidence from NMR and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies, as well as from a new generation of X-ray scattering experiments, has accumulated, indicating that a general tendency to short-range-correlated incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) order is "intertwined" with the superconductivity in this regime. Additionally, transport, STM, neutron-scattering, and optical experiments have produced evidence--not yet entirely understood--of the existence of an associated pattern of long-range-ordered point-group symmetry breaking with an electron-nematic character. We have carried out a theoretical analysis of the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson effective field theory of a classical incommensurate CDW in the presence of weak quenched disorder. Although the possibilities of a sharp phase transition and long-range CDW order are precluded in such systems, we show that any discrete symmetry-breaking aspect of the charge order--nematicity in the case of the unidirectional (stripe) CDW we consider explicitly--generically survives up to a nonzero critical disorder strength. Such "vestigial order," which is subject to unambiguous macroscopic detection, can serve as an avatar of what would be CDW order in the ideal, zero disorder limit. Various recent experiments in the pseudogap regime of the hole-doped cuprates are readily interpreted in light of these results.

A., Kivelson, S. A., Shankar, R., Sondhi, S. L., Spivak, B. Z. 2012; 109 (23) Abstract We study the structure of Bogoliubov quasiparticles, bogolons, the fermionic excitations of paired superfluids that arise from fermion (BCS) pairing, including neutral superfluids, superconductors, and paired quantum Hall states. The naive construction of a stationary quasiparticle in which the deformation of the pair field is neglected leads to a contradiction: it carries a net electrical current even though it does not move. However, treating the pair field self-consistently resolves this problem: in a neutral superfluid, a dipolar current pattern is associated with the quasiparticle for which the total current vanishes. When Maxwell electrodynamics is included, as appropriate to a superconductor, this pattern is confined over a penetration depth. For paired quantum Hall states of composite fermions, the Maxwell term is replaced by a Chern-Simons term, which leads to a dipolar charge distribution and consequently to a dipolar current pattern.

A. 2012; 108 (24) Abstract We study a generalized quantum hard-core dimer model on the square and honeycomb lattices, allowing for first and second neighbor dimers. At generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson points, the exact ground states can be constructed, and ground-state correlation functions can be equated to those of interacting (1+1)-dimensional Grassmann fields. When the concentration of second neighbor dimers is small, the ground-state correlations are shown to be short ranged corresponding to a (gaped) spin liquid phase. On a 2-torus, the ground states exhibit fourfold topological degeneracy. On a finite cylinder we have found a dramatic even-odd effect depending on the circumference and propose that this can be used as a numerical diagnostic of gapped spin-liquid phases, more generally.

Where the results are largely insensitive to the ladder width, we consider the results representative of the 2D square lattice. We find a fully polarized ferromagnetic Fermi liquid phase when n, the density of electrons per site, is in the range 1>n0.800. For n=3/4 we find an unexpected insulating checkerboard phase with coexisting bond-density order with 4 sites per unit cell and block-spin antiferromagnetic order with 8 sites per unit cell. For 3/4>n, all ladders with width >2 have unpolarized ground states.

P. 2011; 108 (40): 16549-16553 Abstract The behavior of matter near zero temperature continuous phase transitions, or "quantum critical points" is a central topic of study in condensed matter physics. In fermionic systems, fundamental questions remain unanswered: the nature of the quantum critical regime is unclear because of the apparent breakdown of the concept of the quasiparticle, a cornerstone of existing theories of strongly interacting metals. Even less is known experimentally about the formation of ordered phases from such a quantum critical "soup." Here, we report a study of the specific heat across the phase diagram of the model system Sr(3)Ru(2)O(7), which features an anomalous phase whose transport properties are consistent with those of an electronic nematic. We show that this phase, which exists at low temperatures in a narrow range of magnetic fields, forms directly from a quantum critical state, and contains more entropy than mean-field calculations predict. Our results suggest that this extra entropy is due to remnant degrees of freedom from the highly entropic state above T(c). The associated quantum critical point, which is "concealed" by the nematic phase, separates two Fermi liquids, neither of which has an identifiable spontaneously broken symmetry, but which likely differ in the topology of their Fermi surfaces.

V., Kivelson, S. A., Spivak, B. 2011; 106 (25) Abstract We develop a hydrodynamic description of the resistivity and magnetoresistance of an electron liquid in a smooth disorder potential. This approach is valid when the electron-electron scattering length is sufficiently short. In a broad range of temperatures, the dissipation is dominated by heat fluxes in the electron fluid, and the resistivity is inversely proportional to the thermal conductivity, . This is in striking contrast to the Stokes flow, in which the resistance is independent of and proportional to the fluid viscosity. We also identify a new hydrodynamic mechanism of spin magnetoresistance.

A., Kivelson, S. A., Sondhi, S. L., Spivak, B. Z. 2011; 106 (23) Abstract The Pfaffian phase in the proximity of a half-filled Landau level is understood to be a p+ip superconductor of composite fermions. We consider the properties of this paired quantum Hall phase when the pairing energy is small, i.e., in the weak-coupling, BCS limit, where the coherence length is much larger than the charge screening length. We find that, as in a type I superconductor, vortices attract so that, upon varying the magnetic field from its magic value at =5/2, the system exhibits Coulomb frustrated phase separation. We propose that the weakly and strongly coupled Pfaffians exemplify a general dichotomy between type I and type II quantum Hall fluids.

A., Orenstein, J., Kapitulnik, A., Shen, Z. 2011; 331 (6024): 1579-1583 Abstract The nature of the pseudogap phase of cuprate high-temperature superconductors is a major unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. We studied the commencement of the pseudogap state at temperature T* using three different techniques (angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, polar Kerr effect, and time-resolved reflectivity) on the same optimally doped Bi2201 crystals. We observed the coincident, abrupt onset at T* of a particle-hole asymmetric antinodal gap in the electronic spectrum, a Kerr rotation in the reflected light polarization, and a change in the ultrafast relaxational dynamics, consistent with a phase transition. Upon further cooling, spectroscopic signatures of superconductivity begin to grow close to the superconducting transition temperature (T(c)), entangled in an energy-momentum-dependent manner with the preexisting pseudogap features, ushering in a ground state with coexisting orders.

A. 2010; 105 (16) Abstract We prove that there exists a class of crystalline insulators, which we call "fragile Mott insulators," which are not adiabatically connected to any sort of band insulator provided time-reversal and certain point-group symmetries are respected, but which are otherwise unspectacular in that they exhibit no topological order nor any form of fractionalized quasiparticles. Different fragile Mott insulators are characterized by different nontrivial one-dimensional representations of the crystal point group. We illustrate this new type of insulators with two examples: the d Mott insulator discovered in the checkerboard Hubbard model at half-filling and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki insulator on the square lattice.

A. 2010; 105 (14) Abstract We show, using density-matrix renormalization-group calculations complemented by field-theoretic arguments, that the spin-gapped phase of the one dimensional Kondo-Heisenberg model exhibits quasi-long-range superconducting correlations only at a nonzero momentum. The local correlations in this phase resemble those of the pair-density-wave state which was recently proposed to describe the phenomenology of the striped ordered high-temperature superconductor La(2-x)Ba(x)CuO, in which the spin, charge, and superconducting orders are strongly intertwined.

A. 2010; 105 (13) Abstract We show that the interplay between spin and charge fluctuations in SrRuO leads unequivocally to triplet pairing which has a hidden quasi-one-dimensional character. The resulting superconducting state spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry and is of the form ~(p(x)+ip(y))z(^) with sharp gap minima and a d vector that is only weakly pinned. The superconductor lacks robust chiral Majorana fermion modes along the boundary. The absence of topologically protected edge modes could explain the surprising absence of experimentally detectable edge currents in this system.

A. 2009; 103 (4) Abstract We investigate the stability of a quadratic band-crossing point (QBCP) in 2D fermionic systems. At the noninteracting level, we show that a QBCP exists and is topologically stable for a Berry flux +/-2pi if the point symmetry group has either fourfold or sixfold rotational symmetries. This putative topologically stable free-fermion QBCP is marginally unstable to arbitrarily weak short-range repulsive interactions. We consider both spinless and spin-1/2 fermions. Four possible ordered states result: a quantum anomalous Hall phase, a quantum spin Hall phase, a nematic phase, and a nematic-spin-nematic phase.

A. 2009; 102 (21) Abstract We have proposed an exactly solvable quantum spin-3/2 model on a square lattice. Its ground state is a quantum spin liquid with a half-integer spin per unit cell. The fermionic excitations, dubbed as "spinons", are gapless with a linear dispersion, while the topological "vison" excitations are gapped. Moreover, these massless fermionic spinon excitations are topologically stable. Thus, this model is, to the best of our knowledge, the first exactly solvable model of half-integer spins whose ground state is an "algebraic spin liquid."

We observed nonzero Kerr rotations of order approximately 1 microrad appearing near the pseudogap temperature T(*) and marking what appears to be a true phase transition. Anomalous magnetic behavior in magnetic-field training of the effect suggests that time reversal symmetry is already broken above room temperature.

The nodes are found to be stable if the Hamiltonian is invariant under time reversal followed by a lattice translation. The principle is demonstrated with a few examples. Some experimental implications of various types of assumed order are discussed in the context of the cuprate superconductors.

This CSL state spontaneously breaks time reversal symmetry but preserves other symmetries. There are two topologically distinct CSL's separated by a quantum critical point. Interestingly, vortex excitations in the topologically nontrivial (Chern number +/-1) CSL obey non-Abelian statistics.

A., Oganesyan, V., Tranquada, J. M., Zhang, S. C. 2007; 99 (12) Abstract In the stripe-ordered state of a strongly correlated two-dimensional electronic system, under a set of special circumstances, the superconducting condensate, like the magnetic order, can occur at a nonzero wave vector corresponding to a spatial period double that of the charge order. In this case, the Josephson coupling between near neighbor planes, especially in a crystal with the special structure of La(2-x)Ba(x)CuO(4), vanishes identically. We propose that this is the underlying cause of the dynamical decoupling of the layers recently observed in transport measurements at x = 1/8.

W., Dahmen, K. A., Fradkin, E., Kivelson, S. A. 2006; 96 (9) Abstract An electron nematic is a translationally invariant state which spontaneously breaks the discrete rotational symmetry of a host crystal. In a clean square lattice, the electron nematic has two preferred orientations, while dopant disorder favors one or the other orientations locally. In this way, the electron nematic in a host crystal maps to the random field Ising model. Since the electron nematic has anisotropic conductivity, we associate each Ising configuration with a resistor network and use what is known about the random field Ising model to predict new ways to test for local electronic nematic order (nematicity) using noise and hysteresis. In particular, we have uncovered a remarkably robust linear relation between the orientational order and the resistance anisotropy which holds over a wide range of circumstances.

Focusing on the superconducting gap, we find patches of what appear to be two different phases in a background of some average gap, one with a relatively small gap and sharp large coherence peaks and one characterized by a large gap with broad weak coherence peaks. We compare these spectra with calculations of the local density of states for a simple phenomenological model in which a 2xi0 x 2xi0 patch with an enhanced or suppressed d-wave gap amplitude is embedded in a region with a uniform average d-wave gap.

In two dimensions (2D), near the critical density, the system is universally unstable to the formation of new intermediate phases, which we call "electronic microemulsion phases," which consist of an intermediate scale mixture of regions of the two competing phases. A corollary is that there can be no direct transition as a function of density from a 2D Wigner crystal to a uniform electron liquid. In 3D, if the strength of the Coulomb interactions exceeds a critical value, no phase separation occurs, while for the weaker Coulomb strength electronic microemulsions are inevitable. This tendency is considerably more pronounced in anisotropic (quasi-2D or quasi-1D) systems, where a devil's staircase of transitions is possible.

P., Kivelson, S. A., Zachar, O. 2004; 92 (6) Abstract We analyze the high-temperature behavior of the susceptibilities towards a number of possible ordered states in the t-J-V model using the high-temperature series expansion. From all diagrams with up to ten edges, reliable results are obtained down to temperatures of order J, or (with some optimism) to J/2. In the unphysical regime, tJ, these susceptibilities are small and decreasing with decreasing temperature; this suggests that the t-J model does not support high-temperature superconductivity. We also find modest evidence of a tendency toward nematic and d-density wave orders.

Y., Kivelson, S. A., Aeppli, G. 2002; 88 (25) Abstract In certain cuprates, a spin-1 resonance mode is prominent in the magnetic structure measured by neutron scattering. It has been proposed that this mode is responsible for significant features seen in other spectroscopies, such as photoemission and optical absorption, which are sensitive to the charge dynamics, and even that this mode is the boson responsible for "mediating" the superconducting pairing. We show that its small (measured) intensity and weak coupling to electron-hole pairs (as deduced from the measured lifetime) disqualifies the resonant mode from either proposed role.

A., Fradkin, E., Emery, V. J. 2001; 87 (16) Abstract We study the properties of a quasi-one-dimensional superconductor which consists of an alternating array of two inequivalent chains. This model is a simple caricature of a striped high temperature superconductor, and is more generally a theoretically controllable system in which the superconducting state emerges from a non-Fermi-liquid normal state. Even in this limit, " d-wave-like" order parameter symmetry is natural, but the superconducting state can either have a complete gap in the quasiparticle spectrum, or gapless "nodal" quasiparticles. We also find circumstances in which antiferromagnetic order (typically incommensurate) coexists with superconductivity.

A., Aeppli, G., Emery, V. J. 2001; 98 (21): 11903-11907 Abstract Copper-oxide-based high-temperature superconductors have complex phase diagrams with multiple ordered phases. It even appears that the highest superconducting transition temperatures for certain cuprates are found in samples that display simultaneous onset of magnetism and superconductivity. We show here how the thermodynamics of fluid mixtures-a touchstone for chemistry as well as hard and soft condensed matter physics-accounts for this startling observation, as well as many other properties of the cuprates in the vicinity of the instability toward "striped" magnetism.

A., Carlson, E. W., Emery, V. J., Zhou, X. J., Shen, Z. X. 2001; 86 (19): 4362-4365 Abstract In the normal state of the high temperature superconductors Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8+delta) and La2(-x)Sr(x)CuO4, and in the related "stripe ordered" material, La(1.25)Nd(0.6)Sr(0.15)CuO4, there is sharp structure in the measured single hole spectral function, A<(k-->,omega), considered as a function of k--> at fixed small binding energy omega. At the same time, as a function of omega at fixed k--> on much of the putative Fermi surface, any structure in A<(k-->,omega), other than the Fermi cutoff, is very broad. This is characteristic of the situation in which there are no stable excitations with the quantum numbers of the electron, as is the case in the one-dimensional electron gas.
