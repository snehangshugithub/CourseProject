We focus on lipoprotein receptors in particular, the High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) receptor called Scavenger Receptor, Class B, Type I (SR-BI). Our analyses have provided insight into basic biological processes, contributed to our understanding of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD) and have uncovered an unexpected connection between cholesterol and mammalian female infertility.
