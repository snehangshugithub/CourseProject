This is achieved by combining traditional physical models and modern data sciences such as statistical inference and machine learning. Specific areas of interests include: Data-Driven Turbulence Modeling; Uncertainty Quantification Computational Fluid Dynamics (e.g., particle-laden flows and turbulence modeling) Ocean Engineering and Marine Renewable Energy See my publication page and Google Scholar profile for details.
