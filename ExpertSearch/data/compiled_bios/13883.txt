Keating Professor of Biology and Biological Engineering; Associate Department Head; Graduate Officer Amy E. Keating determines how proteins make specific interactions with one another and designs new, synthetic protein-protein interactions. 617-452-3398 Phone 68-622A Office keating@mit.edu Email Lab Website Tau Zaman Assistant 617-452-2717 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1998, University of California, Los Angeles SB, 1992, Physics, Harvard University Research Summary Our goal is to understand, at a high level of detail, how the interaction properties of proteins are encoded in their sequences and structures. We investigate protein-protein interactions by integrating data from high throughput assays, structural modeling, and bioinformatics with biochemical and biophysical experiments. Much of our work focuses on -helical coiled-coil proteins, Bcl-2 apoptosis-regulating proteins, and protein domains that bind to short linear motifs.
