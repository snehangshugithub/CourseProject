These mathematical objects describe configurations which evolve by a repeated update of a local rule. Cellular automata have been used to model many natural phenomena and have offered insights into fundamental organizational principles in many scientific fields. From a more abstract perspective, cellular automata are a suitable tool used to characterize and catalog local dynamics which generate a prescribed global phenomenon. An important feature of this field is the interplay between rigorous mathematical analysis and largescale computation, data analysis,and visualization. Selected publications Gravner, J., and J.
