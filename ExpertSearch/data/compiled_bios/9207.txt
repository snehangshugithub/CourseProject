Professor of Computer ScienceAddress:AKW 401, 51 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511203-533-9862 james.aspnes@yale.eduWebsiteJames Aspnes is a Professor of Computer Science at Yale University. He holds an S.B. in Mathematics and an S.M. in Computer Science and Engineering from MIT, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie-Mellon University. James Aspnes research emphasizes the use of randomization to solve difficult core problems in the theory of distributed algorithms. His recent work has concentrated on tools for managing large-scale loosely structured systems as found in peer-to-peer networks and wireless sensor networks. These tools include novel distributed data structures supporting efficient range queries over large data sets scattered across many machines, new models of distributed computation that capture the limited resources of individual nodes in sensor systems, and mechanisms for providing security and fault-tolerance in large-scale systems with no restrictions on the arrival of new and possibly malevolent participants. His interests also include related problems in biology, economics, and learning theory. Professor Aspnes is a member of the editorial board for Algorithmica, has served as program committee chair for the PODC 2005 and DCOSS 2007 conferences, and has served on numerous conference program committees. He is a recipient of the Dylan Hixon Prize for Teaching Excellence in the Natural Sciences.
