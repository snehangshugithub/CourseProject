Courses taught: Molecular Biology (Bio 439), Molecular & Cellular Foundations (Bio 120), Biotechnology (Bio 316) and Genetics ( Bio 301). Research Interest: As cell division is one of the most fundamental processes in the growth and development from plants to animals but also cell death is a natural part of life. Every day in the human body, 50-70 billion cells die, making room for the equivalent number of new cells produced daily through cell division. I have a broadly trained experience in cell cycle and cell death from my PhD to postdoc period. My research interest would be the molecular and biochemical control of the cell cycle and related processes towards the cell death in different cells. Dr. Ehsan is broadly trained Molecular Biologist and teaches a diversity of existing courses and new courses to compliment to the graduate and undergraduate biology curriculum. Dr. Ehsan joined the UHV family in August of 2011, and currently serving as a program Director of Biology Graduate Studies since March 2020 (MS in Biomedical Science). Peer-reviewed Publications: 1.
