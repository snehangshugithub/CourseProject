RajeevProfessor of Physics and MathematicsPhD in Physics, Syracuse University, 1984351Bausch & Lomb Hall(585) 275-4796 Fax: (585) 273-3237s.g.rajeev@rochester.eduWebsiteResearch OverviewProfessor Rajeev works on various problems in theoretical physics arising fromhigh-energy physics, as well as other fields such as string theory, nonlinear optics, hydrodynamics and quantum information theory. The focus of most recent work has been on non-commutative geometry and probability theory, which has applications to understanding Yang-Mills fields as well as to string theory and even classical problems in hydrodynamics. Solitons in field theories of high energy physics and nonlinear optics is another theme of research. Department of Physics and Astronomy University of Rochester 206 Bausch and Lomb Hall P.O.
