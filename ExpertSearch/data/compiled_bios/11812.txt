He left academia 1999-2009, to work at Kestrel Institute at Palo Alto. He was a Visiting Professor at Oxford University 2008-2012, and a Professor of Information Security at Royal Holloway University of London 2010-2013. Since 2014 he has lead ASECOLab (Adaptive Security and Economics Lab), the designated research institute for Cyber Security and Information Assurance at University of Hawaii at Manoa. Through years, his publications spanned a wide area of research interests, from mathematics (graphs, categories) and quantum information theory (toy models, graphic formalisms), through theoretical computer science (semantics, symbolic computation) and software engineering (behavioral specifications, adaptation), to security and privacy (protocols, trust, strategies) and network computation (concept analysis). Most of his research publications can be downloaded from his personal home page.
