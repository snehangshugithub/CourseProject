He has specialized in the application of evolutionary computation to problems in design and manufacturing. Together with associated researchers, he has developed systems that perform structural topology optimization, shape pattern nesting, finite element mesh generation, antenna design, and the optimal arrangement of piezoelectric actuators on aerodynamic surfaces. More recently, he has investigated computer-based systems that allow engineering design and product development to be done by web-based user communities, as well as comprehensive cost models for remanufacturing processes. He has had collaborative research projects with many industry partners, including Ford, Nissan, Hitachi, and Boeing.More recently, he has developed new courses in mechanical fabrication and Computer-aided engineering for mechanical design. Biography Professor Jakiela came to Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At MIT, he was named a National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator in mechanical engineering and served as Associate Director of the MIT Computer-Aided Design Lab. At WashU, Professor Jakiela teaches courses related to engineering design, including Machine Elements and Senior Design Projects for undergraduates, and Engineering Optimization, and The Computer-aided Mechanical Engineering Design Process for graduate students.
