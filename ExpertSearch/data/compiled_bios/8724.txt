Trumper joined the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering in August 1993, and holds the rank of Professor. He received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from MIT in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, in 1980, 1984, and 1990, respectively. Following the Bachelor's degree, Professor Trumper worked two years for the Hewlett-Packard Co. After finishing the Master's degree, he worked for two years for the Waters Chromatography Division of Millipore. Upon completing the Ph.D. degree, for three years he was an Assistant Professor in the Electrical Engineering Department at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, working within the precision engineering group. Professor Trumper's research centers on the design of precision mechatronic systems, with a focus on the design of novel mechanisms, actuators, sensors, and control systems. He has conducted research in topics including precision motion control, high-performance manufacturing equipment, novel measurement instruments, biomedical and bioinstrumentation devices, and high-precision magnetic suspensions and bearings. He is a member of the IEEE, ASME, and ASPE (past-President).
