The research encompassed hydrogen microgrids, hydrogen storage for off-grid electricity supply, and computer modelling of all aspects of renewable energy systems from the device to the enterprise level. He obtained his PhD in Engineering Physics from Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia. The thesis focused on modelling the principal components of hybrid energy systems that include energy storage in the form of hydrogen. Before his PhD, Dr Abdin worked for Telenor's telecommunications company as a senior manager and was actively involved with the research and development team for more than five years. He also served as a university lecturer for two years and taught primarily Fundamental of Physics, Semiconductor Physics, Solid-state Physics, and Digital electronics. Dr Abdin has a strong commitment to, and interest in clean and hydrogen energy technologies; especially generation, system integration, and improved energy security and decarbonised world economy: - Clean and hydrogen energy technologies. - Hydrogen value chain - generation to end-use. - Smart energy systems. - Energy storage. - Advanced physics-based modelling and simulation. - Techno-economic, sustainability and reliability analysis.
