His research focuses on seismic risk analysis and design of critical engineering structures; reliability and safety analysis of engineering systems; dynamic stability of structures; structural dynamics and random vibration; nonlinear dynamics, and stochastic mechanics. Professor Xies primary research pertains to the reliability, and safety analysis and design of nuclear power plants; on-shore and off-shore structures; and tall buildings that are subjected to loading caused by earthquakes, ocean waves, and wind turbulence. The objective of his research is to have a better understanding of the dynamic behaviour of structures, and to provide methods for safety and reliability analysis, and design of structures, machinery, and engineering systems as a whole. As a result of his research and teaching, Professor Xie has received several awards such as the Distinguished Teacher Award from the University of Waterloo in 2007, and Teaching Excellence Award from the Faculty of Engineering in 2001. He also received the Distinguished Performance Award for outstanding contribution in teaching, scholarship and service in 2000, 2006, and 2013. Professor Xie has written 2 textbooks: Dynamic Stability of Structures and Differential Equations for Engineers, both published by the Cambridge University Press. He has authored and co-authored over 100 referred journal publications. He is a member of the Canadian Standards Association N289 Technical Committee on Seismic Design. He also serves as the Associate Editor or Member of Editorial Board of a number of international journals, such as the ASME Journal of Applied Mechanics, Mechanics Based Design of Structures and Machines, Journal of Nonlinear Systems and Applications, and Advances in Civil Engineering.Research InterestsStructural dynamics and random vibrationdynamic stability of structuresnonlinear dynamics and stochastic mechanicsLocalization in randomly disordered structuresVibration design using cold-formedresidential floor systemsStructuresMechanics & ConstructionSeismic analysisreliability and safety analysisApplied mechanics and stochastic systemsEducation1990, Doctorate, PhD, University of Waterloo1987, Master's, MASc, University of Waterloo1986, Master's, MEng, Ministry of Aerospace1984, Bachelor's, BE, Shanghai Jiao TongCourses*AE 221 - Advanced CalculusTaught in 2020, 2021CIVE 105 - Mechanics 2Taught in 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021CIVE 222 - Differential EquationsTaught in 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021CIVE 701 - Topics in MechanicsTaught in 2016* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsLiu, Xinzhi and Zhang, Kexue and Xie, Wei-Chau, Pinning Impulsive Synchronization of Reaction-Diffusion Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delays, , 2016Wang, Zhaoliang and Xie, Wei-Chau and Pandey, MD, Computationally Efficient Vector-Valued Seismic Risk Analysis of Engineering Structures, Journal of Structural Engineering, 2016Alwan, Mohamad S and Liu, Xinzhi and Xie, Wei-Chau, Stability properties of nonlinear stochastic impulsive systems with time delay, Stochastic Analysis and Applications, 34(1), 2016, 117 - 136Wang, Xiying and Liu, Xinzhi and Xie, Wei-chau and Xu, Wei and Xu, Yong, Global stability and persistence of HIV models with switching parameters and pulse control, Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 123, 2016, 53 - 67Graduate StudiesCurrently considering applications from graduate students.
