University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Areas of Expertise Combinatorial Optimization Experimental Mathematics Operations Research Background After completing my B.S. in Mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2009, I moved to Berlin on a full scholarship from the Berlin Mathematical School. I did my graduate work at the Technische Universitt Berlin while simultaneously joining the interdisciplinary Zuse Institute Berlin where I gained expertise in combinatorial optimization and algorithmic discrete mathematics. My own research interests apply these techniques to theoretical questions in extremal combinatorics. Before joining Davidson, I spent three semesters as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill, Barbados. I consider myself a dedicated educational guide and am committed to active learning and collaboration as well as diversity and inclusion.
