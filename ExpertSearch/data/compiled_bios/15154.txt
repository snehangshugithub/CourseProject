Personal profile Research interestsProfile Dr Robinson worked as a design engineer before joining the University of Bath as a lecturer. He worked on high-frequency power converters and controls for the machine-drives industry, and specialised power electronics for the control of electromagnetic fields at the Science and Engineering Research Councils Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), Oxfordshire. He was responsible for the design and development of the 0.8 MW AC power-supply for the main beam-line magnets of the ISIS proton synchrotron operating at RAL, Oxfordshire. He has a PhD from Herriot-Watt University, Edinburgh. Research Analysis and design of power electronics for high performance motor drives, power-factor correction and power conversion systems.The application and low-noise switching of modern power semiconductor devices. Optimising the electrical and thermal utilisation of modern power-semiconductor-devices, e.g. power MOSFET, IGBT, IGCT, GCT, FRED diodes in high-frequency machine inverters, active filters and switching amplifiers.Modelling and simulation of power-semiconductor effects and power electronics systems.Willing to supervise doctoral studentsInterested in supervising students studying; Power electronics and drivesSwitch-mode power converters and amplifiersPower semiconductor application.
