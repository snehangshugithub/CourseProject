In particular, he is interested in the dynamics of multiphase flows, such as bubbles in water and droplets in air. This type of flows arise in many engineering and environmental problems such as the exchange of gases between the atmosphere and the ocean, the formation of rain drops in clouds, the atomization of liquids in combustion and manufacturing processes and the dynamics of microbubbles injected in the human circulation to enhance ultrasound imaging and therapeutic use.Professor Aliseda uses a large number of experimental techniques (laser doppler velocimetry, laser induced fluorescence, particle image velocimetry, hot-wire anemometry, phase doppler particle analysis, etc.) to gain insight into the fundamental physics of these complex flows. He complements these experimental studies with mathematical analysis and modeling in order to extract useful information that can be applied outside the laboratory in real world problems.
