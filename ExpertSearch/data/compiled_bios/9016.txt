From 1995 until 2008, she was Assistant, Associate, and Full Professor at the Pennsylvania State University in Kinesiology and Integrative Biosciences. At Northeastern, she holds an interdisciplinary appointment in the departments of Biology, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Physics. Her research in computational neuroscience and motor control focuses on learning and control of sensorimotor coordination in humans, both in healthy and neurologically impaired individuals. This work spans behavioral experiments with mathematical models of control and nonlinear dynamics, bridging biology with engineering and physics. The results are documented in over 80 publications in scientific journals and several books. The research has been continuously supported by grants from the National Institute of Health, the National Science Foundation and Office of Naval Research.The central interest of research in the Action Lab is the control and coordination of goal-directed human behavior. Adopting a systems-level approach we aim to reveal the organizational principles of the nervous system in interaction with the mechanical system of the body and the environment. Our research strategy intertwines behavioral experiments on human subjects with theoretical work using mathematical models of movement generation. The theoretical approach views the actor in the environment as a dynamical system, which is high-dimensional and nonlinear. Our experimental research focuses on single- and multi- joint human movements including upper limb manipulation tasks and locomotion examined in virtual environments. We have extended these experimental paradigms to study the elderly and patients with neurological disorders such as Parkinsons disease.Honors & Awards2021-22 Fulbright Award to research Variability and Redundancy in Motor Learning at the Santa Lucia Foundation at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, ItalyKlein Lectureship AwardDistinguished Lecturer on Life and the Sciences of Complexity, Center for the Ecological Study of Perception and Action Toggle Accordion Research Research OverviewMotor control and learning, variability and stability, virtual rehabilitation, dynamic modeling, rhythmic and discrete movements as primitives for actionPredictability in complex object control, Hierarchical coordination of complex actions, Learning to control dynamically complex objects, Neural basis of motor expertise, Characterization of predictive abilities in individuals with ASD using web-based interactive gamesSelected Research ProjectsMovement as a Vital Sign in Preterm Infants Investigator, National Science FoundationCollaborative Research: Learning to Control Dynamically Complex Objects Co-Investigator, National Science FoundationCollaborative Research: Neural Basis of Motor Expertise Principal Investigator, National Institutes of HealthCollaborative Research: Towards Robots with Human Dexterity Principal Investigator, National Science FoundationPredictability in Complex Object Control Principal Investigator, National Institutes of HealthUS-German-Israeli Collaborative Research: Hierarchical Coordination of Complex Actions Principal Investigator, National Science FoundationResearch Centers and InstitutesInstitute for Experiential RoboticsCollege Research Initiatives BioMachine Integration link Integrated Modeling, Inference, and Computing link Toggle Accordion Publications Selected PublicationsBalasubramaniam, Ramesh, Haegens, Saskia, Jazayeri, Mehrdad, Merchant, Hugo, Sternad, Dagmar, Song, Joo-Hyun (2021).
