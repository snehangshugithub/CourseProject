Electrochemical Devices convert and utilize chemical and electrical energies at high efficiencies and are thus eminently suited for many applications resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Life and cost of these devices and systems are principal barriers to their commercialization. On-going research in Professor Pals laboratory are on: solid oxide fuel cells, solid-oxide-membrane based electrolytic cells for converting waste to hydrogen, hydrogen storage materials, solid-oxide-membrane based inert anodes for green syntheses of energy-intensive metals, and devices based on mixed-ion-electron-conducting oxide membranes for generating and separating pure hydrogen from hydrocarbons enabling CO2 sequestration.
