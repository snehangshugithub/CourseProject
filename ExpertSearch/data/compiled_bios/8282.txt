His work finds application in heat exchangers, energy systems, materials processing and manufacturing.His research on fin arrays, heat exchangers, two-phase flow and other aspects of applied heat transfer has contributed to the development of next-generation end-use energy systems that are more efficient and less damaging to the environment than existing technologies. His recent experimental research on evaporation in small (sub-millimeter) channels has already led to development of physical models of the phenomena. This work is explaining phenomena that dominate convective heat transfer in evaporators operating nearer to critical pressures, as observed in recent years with refrigerants R410A and R744.He is co-director of the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Center, overseeing a multidisciplinary research program involving more than a dozen faculty members, 60 graduate and undergraduate students, post-doctoral and visiting scholars, and companies from around the world. The ACRC is the largest center in the nation devoted to research in heating, ventilating, air conditioning and refrigeration. Its research program is supported by approximately 30 industrial sponsors.
