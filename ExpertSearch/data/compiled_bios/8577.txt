An honors graduate of Princeton University and the Ohio State University College of Medicine, he completed postgraduate training in Internal Medicine, Hematology and Medical Oncology at the University of California, San Diego, and the Naval Regional Medical Center, San Diego.He served as Chief of the International Cancer Research Data Bank of the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, and was also Director of the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, which is a computer research and development division of the National Library of Medicine. He also served as Director of Biomedical Informatics at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, Director of the UCSD Human Research Protections Program, and Professor of Medicine. Dr. Masys is an elected member of the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) of the National Academy of Sciences. He is a Diplomate of the American Board of Internal Medicine in Medicine, Hematology, and Medical Oncology. He is a Fellow of the American College of Physicians, and Fellow and Past President of the American College of Medical Informatics. Dr. Masys' professional interests include development of informatics infrastructure for conducting clinical and translational research, genome-phenome correlation using phenotype data derived from electronic medical records data, and approaches to incorporating genomic data effectively into clinical systems.
