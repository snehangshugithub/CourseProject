New projects involve characterization of neurotoxins in the spit of a predatory bug.My research focuses on the neural mechanisms of behavior in arthropods. We ask questions about how the nervous system integrates sensory information, primarily visual, auditory, and proprioceptive, to produce adaptive behaviors. Moreover, several projects in the lab take an evolutionary approach to the function of sense organs.My research focuses on the neural mechanisms of behavior in arthropods.

Moreover, several projects in the lab take an evolutionary approach to the function of sense organs.Outreach and Extension FocusAlthough I do not have a formal outreach/extension appointment, I recognize the value of such activities. Thus, I identify images of arthropods submitted to the New York Conservationist Magazine. I have also published articles there. Additionally, I give workshops in insect biology for New York State Master Naturalists.Teaching FocusI co-teach the Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology course. I teach an introductory level course on insect biology in even fall semesters. I teach in the Evolution & Biodiversity course. My responsibility is the animal Tree of Life. I teach in fall and spring semesters. I teach a two-week module with lab in an upper level course on insect physiology in even spring semesters.Additional LinksDepartment website Awards and HonorsRichards-Hodson Lectureship in Insect Physiology (2014) University of MinnesotaChancellor's Award for Excellence in Teaching (2010) State University of New York Selected PublicationsJournal PublicationsZurek, D.
