His research focuses on financial mathematics, utility optimization, market with transaction costs, counterparty risk, and valuation adjustments. His current projects include finding the asymptotic optimal strategy for portfolio optimization in a stochastic environment driven by correlated factors; identifying optimal electricity distribution pricing and optimal distributed photovoltaic generation by rational consumers, and exploring deep learning in a market with transaction costs. Bichuchs research has been supported by the National Science Foundation. He has also published in and refereed for journals such as Finance & Stochastics, Mathematical Finance and SIAM Journal on Financial Mathematics. Bichuch earned a masters degree in mathematics in finance from New York University in 2003, and a PhD in financial mathematics from Carnegie Mellon University in 2010. After completing postdoctoral research at Princeton University, Bichuch worked two years as an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. He joined the Whiting School of Engineering faculty in 2015.
