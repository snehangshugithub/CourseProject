Rhodes Hall 607/255-9130fms9@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyFrans Schalekamp received his Ph.D. in Operations Research from Cornell University in 2007. He has worked both in academia and in industry on three continents, and on areas ranging from plant breeding and genetics to logistics. Former academic positions were at the Institute for Theoretical Computer Science at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, the Department of Mathematics at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Va., and the Computer Science Department at Cornell University. He held positions in industry as a research scientist at NatureSourceGenetics in Ithaca, N.Y., and as a senior analyst at CarMax in Richmond, Va.Research InterestsFrans's research interests lie in optimization, both in practice and theory. He has worked on problems in bioinformatics, sensor networks and information science. His interest in theoretical aspects of optimization is focused in particular on designing approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems, and understanding limitations on finding good solutions to problems. Practical implementations and seeing how well methods do in practice is a further interest. At NatureSourceGenetics he designed practical algorithms for finding good plant breeding strategies.Teaching InterestsFrans has taught courses in operations research, computer science and mathematics departments. Courses he taught at Cornell include ORIE 3310 (Optimization II), ENGRI 1101 (Engineering Applications of Operations Research), ORIE 4580 (Simulation Modeling and Analysis), CS 4820 (Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms) (co-taught with Bobby Kleinberg). He also enjoyed teaching calculus and linear algebra at William & Mary.Selected PublicationsFrans Schalekamp, Andrs Seb, Vera Traub and Anke van Zuylen Layers and Matroids for the Traveling Salesman's PathsOperations Research Letters 46(1) (2018) pp. 60-63http://doi.org/10.1016/j.orl.2017.11.002Frans Schalekamp, David P.
