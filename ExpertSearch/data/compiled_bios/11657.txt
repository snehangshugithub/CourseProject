He obtained a B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering from Hanoi University of Technology (Vietnam), and M.S. and PhD degrees in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley (USA). Prior to joining the University of Waterloo, Anh was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Carleton University (Jan 2015- Dec 2018), and a Postdoctoral Associate at Duke University (2012 2014). His research group applies aquatic chemistry and geochemistry principles, and employs analytical chemistry tools to investigate contaminant fate and transformation. The current research focuses on developing novel technologies for the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, treatment of various industrial waste streams including oil sands produced water, and removal of emerging contaminants.Research InterestsAquatic Chemistry and GeochemistryContaminant Fate and TransportRemediation of Soil and GroundwaterEmerging contaminantsPer- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)Water/Wastewater TreatmentEducation2012, Doctorate, Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California Berkeley2007, Master of Applied Science, Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California Berkeley2005, Bachelor of Applied Science, Chemical Engineering, Hanoi University of TechnologyCourses*CIVE 770 - Topics in Environmental EngTaught in 2019, 2020ENVE 275 - Environmental ChemistryTaught in 2019, 2020, 2021ENVE 497 - Special Topics in ENVETaught in 2020* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsCarey, Grant R and McGregor, Rick and Pham, Anh Le-Tuan and Sleep, Brent and Hakimabadi, Seyfollah Gilak, Evaluating the longevity of a PFAS in situ colloidal activated carbon remedy, Remediation Journal, 29(2), 2019, 17 - 31Zrinyi, Nick and Pham, Anh Le-Tuan, Oxidation of benzoic acid by heat-activated persulfate: effect of temperature on transformation pathway and product distribution, Water research, 120, 2017, 43 - 51Pham, Anh Le-Tuan and Johnson, Carol and Manley, Devon and Hsu-Kim, Heileen, Influence of sulfide nanoparticles on dissolved mercury and zinc quantification by diffusive gradient in thin-film passive samplers, Environmental science & technology, 49(21), 2015, 12897 - 12903Pham, Anh Le-Tuan and Morris, Amanda and Zhang, Tong and Ticknor, Jonathan and Levard, Clment and Hsu-Kim, Heileen, Precipitation of nanoscale mercuric sulfides in the presence of natural organic matter: Structural properties, aggregation, and biotransformation, Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, 133, 2014, 204 - 215Pham, Anh Le-Tuan and Doyle, Fiona M and Sedlak, David L, Response to Comment on ?Inhibitory Effect of Dissolved Silica on H2O2 Decomposition by Iron (III) and Manganese (IV) Oxides: Implications for H2O2--Based In Situ Chemical Oxidation?, Environmental science & technology, 46(6), 2012, 3593 - 3594Graduate StudiesCurrently considering applications from graduate students.
