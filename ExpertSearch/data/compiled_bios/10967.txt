Personal Information I am a theoretical physicist, with main interests in particle physics, cosmology and gravity theory. More details can be found by those curious enough to scrutinize my publications (and cites ) in the Spires database. Some glimpses in my work can be gained by exploring some recent lectures I gave, * A Natural Framework for Chaotic Inflation * Large Field Inflation, Ignobly * How I Learned to Like w<-1 Dark Energy * Exorcising w<-1 * Origin of Primordial Perturbations My Interests I'll think of something more eventually, meanwhile I am busy with my work, kids and a new family member! Meanwhile, you can look at some recent comments by other about my work: Cosmological Constant Redefined Axiverse Links: UC Davis Cosmology UC Davis High Energy Theory Last updated: Winter 2011 nkaloperATucdavis.edu (replace AT by @ in case you want to email me).
