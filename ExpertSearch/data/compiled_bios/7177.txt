My research focusses on the highest-energy sites in nature--the big bang, exploding stars (supernovae), and high-energy particles in space (cosmic rays)--where nuclear physics and elementary particle physics play a central role. Understanding these processes and their interplay allows us to trace the history of matter over cosmic time. Turning the problem around, I use these high-energy phenomena as particle accelerators to probe fundamental physics in ways inaccessible to terrestrial experiment. EducationPhD in Physics.

He was recognized for his pioneering contributions to cosmology, nuclear and particle astrophysics, nucleosynthesis, cosmic-ray physics, gamma-ray astronomy, astrobiology, and supernovae. Supernova May Have Caused Mass ExtinctionProfessor Brian Fields and graduate students Ada Ertel and Jesse Miller have published a paper linking a supernova to a mass extinction millions of years ago. Read the article here. Excellent Teachers Fall 2018Four professors, one instructor, and one TA are on the Fall 2018 Excellent Teacher list. Professors Bryan Dunne and Brian Fields were listed as Outstanding. Others on the list include: Professors Charles Gammie, Joaquin Vieira, and Tony Wong, Instructor Amanda Winans, and TA Melanie Archipley.... Xilu Wang Earns PhDXilu Wang successfully defended her PhD thesis, "Supernovae as gamma ray emitters from the MeV to the TeV." She is moving on to a N3AS Postdoctoral Fellowship at Notre Dame and Berkeley. Congratulations Dr. Wang! New Evidence for Near-Earth Supernova Explosions Test Illinois Astronomers' PredictionsEvidence of two near-Earth supernova explosions appears in the current issue of Nature. Prof. Brian Fields discusses these new findings and how nearby supernovae could affect the Earth.
