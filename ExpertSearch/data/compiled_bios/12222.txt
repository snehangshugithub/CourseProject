Hendry is associate professor at The Information School, University of Washington, where he teaches courses in human-computer interaction, information system design, and foundations of information science. He investigates tools, practices, and systems that create the conditions for sustainable, inclusive participation in the design of information systems. Working with the theory and method of Value Sensitive Design, he is currently conducting studies on the use of information systems by homeless young people and drop-in centers that support their welfare. He is a member of the Value Sensitive Design Research Laboratory.David also serves as an Adjunct Associate Professor in the Department of Human-Centered Design and Engineering.He has published on information management in design, design education, search, and end-user programming. In 1998, before joining the iSchool in 2002, he created the User Experience Group at Lycos one of the first internet search engines where he conducted user research on a variety of internet search and communication products. He received his PhD in Computer Science from the Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, Scotland in 1996. For his dissertation, he developed a user-interface architecture for implementing diverse families of information retrieval applications. He received his BA in 1986 and a MSc in 1989 in Computing and Information Science from the University of Guelph.
