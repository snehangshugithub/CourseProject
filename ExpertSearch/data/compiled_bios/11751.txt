This includes the study of both particles and gases in the troposphere, their sources, sinks, transformations, long range transport and environmental impacts. I work at the intersection of modeling and observational analysis, with a strong emphasis on the integration of the two. This involves using observations of the atmosphere from all scales: from ground stations, aircraft campaigns and satellite sensors with global models of chemistry and climate.Teaching Interests1.085/12.336 Air Pollution1.841/12.817J Atmospheric Composition in the Changing Earth System1.013 Senior Civil and Environmental Engineering DesignSelected PublicationsRidley, D.A., C.L.
