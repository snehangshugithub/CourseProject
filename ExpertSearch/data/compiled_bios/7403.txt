McLaughlin Silver Professor of Mathematics and Neural Science david.mclaughlin@nyu.edu 212-998-3077 2 MetroTech Center, Office 868 http://math.nyu.edu/faculty/dmac Education Ph.D., Physics, Indiana University, USA, 1971. M.S., Physics, Indiana University, USA, 1969. B.S., Physics, Creighton University, USA, 1966. Research Interests I work in theoretical visual neural science, with emphasis upon modeling of the primary visual cortex. The work requires methods from four aspects of modern applied mathematics (mathematical modeling, computational science, formal asymptotics, and mathematical analysis), together with direct use of experimental data and design.
