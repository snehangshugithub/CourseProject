Ham Radio, We 4:00PM - 6:59PM, Cory 531 Biography Michael (Miki) Lustig is a slightly above average Professor in EECS with well below average sense of humor. He joined the faculty of the EECS Department at UC Berkeley in Spring 2010. He received his B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology in 2002. He received his Msc and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in 2004 and 2008, respectively. His research focuses on computational imaging methods in medical imaging, particularly Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Miki is a jolly good Fellow of the Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.
