Over the years, the evolution of aging has served as a conceptual focus for much of our work, but the lab is equally marked by the diversity of interests of the students and post-docs, from host-parasite coevolution, to sexual selection and sexual conflict, to the evolution of networks. In addition to a focus on the evolution of aging, an interest in natural genetic variation serves as a common thread running through much of our work. The lab is known not only for its diverse questions, but also for its diverse approaches, from experimental and comparative studies in Drosophila, to epidemiological studies in dogs, to metabolomic assays of Common marmosets, to quantitative genetic models of sexual selection in 19th century Mormons.
