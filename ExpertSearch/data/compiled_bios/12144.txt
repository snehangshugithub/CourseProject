He is also a researcher in the Waterloo Institute of Nanotechnology and the head of the Nanomechanics Research Institute. The groups research focuses on elastic constraint effects on small scale fractures in thin films, mechanical reliability of nano-scale devices, fracture of porous brittle materials used in advanced integrated circuits, and the mechanical properties of materials for lead free solder applications. Professor Tsuis group has also developed techniques to fabricate nanometer scale structures for various applications. These processing methods include plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), e-beam lithography, and electroplating. In 2013, Professor Tsui began a research collaboration with Dr. Frank Gu, working to understand how bacterial cells interact with mental nanopillars. They aim to develop novel nanometer scale surface features that can diminish the adhesion strength between metals and bacterial cells, which can reduce the chance of infection after metal implantation surgeries. In addition to his research work, Professor Tsui holds 29 patents and has published more than 50 journal manuscripts.Research InterestsIntegrate circuitsPECVDLow-k dielectricsNanoindentationFractureSemi-conductorsNanotechnologyCeramicsAdhesionPlasma-Enhanced chemical vapor depositionPorous ultra-low-dielectric constant materialsNano-mechanicsThin film mechanical propertiesEducation1997, Doctorate, Materials Science, Rice University1992, Master's, Materials Science, Rice University1990, Bachelor's, Ceramic Engineering, Clemson UniversityCourses*CHE 750 - Tpcs in ElectrochemistryTaught in 2017CHE 755 - Res Tpcs in Electrochem.
