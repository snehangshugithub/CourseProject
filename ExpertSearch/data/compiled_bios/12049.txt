Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Biography I am a lecturer in cyber security at the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CSEE). Prior to this, I worked as a senior research officer in the Communications group of CSEE, contributing to a number of national and European projects. Further, I worked as a graduate DevOps engineering in BSkyB. I Received my PhD in Electronic and Computing Systems from the University of Essex in 2015; and, my MSc in Computer and Information Networks from the University of Essex in 2010. My research interests focus on future networking architecutres, including Information-Centric Networking (ICN), Fog Computing, Serverless Computing, Cyber Security, Content Distribution Networks and Intelligent Optical Networks. I'm also interested in networking problems associated with health and wellbeing applications.
