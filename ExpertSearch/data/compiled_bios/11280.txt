Her research evaluates the effects of nutrition on immune function, athletic performance, and reproduction in horses. She also works on identifying management and nutrition solutions that will help to minimize the environmental impact of horse manure on water quality. Programs Research Research Summary My research program focuses primarily in three areas: 1) nutrition to enhance immune function (eg, with omega 3/6 fatty acids, trace minerals, amino acids, beta glucans); 2) nutrition to enhance athletic performance (eg, antioxidant status, muscle physiology); and 3) nutrient excretion and the environment (phosphorus, nitrogen). I also periodically branch into other areas that may involve nutrition, such as the impact of nutrition on reproductive function in mares, as well as the use of nutrition to modulate behavior and cognitive function in young horses.
