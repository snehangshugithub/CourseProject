My later work was in oxygen transport to tissue, including theoretical models of oxygen unloading from red cells and oxygen uptake at mitochondria. My most recent interest has been in mathematical modeling of disease transmission and epidemics. In addition I have collaborated with several groups at Rochester by supplying mathematical analyses. This work includes diffusion on membrane surfaces, transport in fuel cells, and thermal models of the transient events associated with the Pinatubo volcanic eruption.One of my interests in recent years has been the teaching of applied mathematics to engineers, scientists, and mathematicians. Courses taught include Diffusion (ME 405), Dynamical Systems (ME 406), Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems (ME 201/MTH 281), Complex Variables (ME 202/MTH 282), Numerical Methods (ME 211), and Ordinary Differential equations (ME 163). For several of these courses I have developed extensive software and computer examples. For those courses, the links in the list above will take you to a web site with the course materials. For the dynamical systems course, I have written a comprehensive package for integrating systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and for visualizing their solutions. The package is available online, and there is a link to it in reference nine on the list below.For additional information,click herefor my personal web page.Representative PublicationsOxygen Delivery from Red Cells(A.
