Read our event summaries to learn about some of the strategies and technologies that leading organizations utilize to improve the efficiency, resilience, agility, and sustainability of their global value chain operations. Event Summaries Event Summary Value Chains in a Post-COVID World COVID-19 accelerated existing trends and forced organizations to re-examine their value chains and the resources they devote to them. Technological advancements will keep improving value chain operations, but will not eliminate reliance on human judgement. Event Summary Value Chains in Turbulent Times Trade tensions, natural disasters, and the current global pandemic bring with them many challenges. Yet a variety of strategies, technologies, and digital innovations can help companies reduce risk and enhance supply chain resilience and agility. Event Summary Leveraging Blockchain for Value Chain Innovation Blockchain technology has real potential to provide business value. While many technical, financial, and regulatory hurdles still remain, blockchain offers significant opportunity for innovation along the value chain. Event Summary Responsible Supply Chains While companies face many challenges to increasing corporate social responsibility in their supply chains, targeted initiatives and promising new technologies can create a positive impact in a changing world. Event Summary The Promise of AI AI has yielded business benefits in design, manufacturing, logistics, sales and end use, but we are still in the early days of AI-enabled business value. If managers can successfully navigate biases, lack of algorithm transparency, effective human-machine collaboration, and other challenges, AI can become a valuable tool to strengthen the value chain.
