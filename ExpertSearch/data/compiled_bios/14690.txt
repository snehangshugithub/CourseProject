Engineering, University of Michigan M.S.E. Sustainable Chemical Engineering Systems, University of Michigan B.S. Chemical Engineering, Purdue UniversityResearch InterestsJennifer Dunn studies emerging technologies, their energy and environmental impacts, and their potential to influence air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, and energy consumption at the economy-wide level. Particular technologies of interest include biofuels and bioproducts, automotive lithium-ion batteries, fuels and chemicals made from carbon capture and utilization technologies and from natural gas liquids. She applies life cycle analysis as a key tool to evaluate emerging technologies. Furthermore, she characterizes land use and land use change through collaborations with economic modelers and computer vision experts. Jennifer is the Director of Research for the Northwestern-Argonne Institute of Science and Engineering (NAISE) and in that role works with faculty at Northwestern and scientists and engineers at Argonne in many areas including the energy-water nexus, materials science, high-performance computing, and synthetic biology. She is especially interested in connecting Northwestern graduate and undergraduate students with research opportunities at Argonne through federal agency- and Northwestern-sponsored opportunities - to expose them to the exciting national laboratory research environment.Significant Professional ServiceMember, National Academies Committee on Developing a Research Agenda for Utilization of Gaseous Carbon Waste Streams, 2017-2018Associate Editor, SAE International Journal of Sustainable Transportation, Energy, Environment, and Policy, 2019- presentSelected PublicationsQin, Zhangcai; Deng, Shiyu; Dunn, Jennifer; Smith, Pete; Sun, Wenjuan, Animal waste use and implications to agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, Environmental Research Letters 16(6).Copenhaver, Ken; Hamada, Yuki; Mueller, Steffen; Dunn, Jennifer B., Examining the characteristics of the cropland data layer in the context of estimating land cover change, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information 10(5).Allen, David T.; Chen, Qining; Dunn, Jennifer B., Consistent Metrics Needed for Quantifying Methane Emissions from Upstream Oil and Gas Operations, Environmental Science and Technology Letters 8(4):345-349.Danielson, Nathan; McKay, Sarah; Bloom, Paul; Dunn, Jennifer; Jakel, Neal; Bauer, Timothy; Hannon, John; Jewett, Michael C.; Shanks, Brent, Industrial Biotechnology - An Industry at an Inflection Point, Industrial Biotechnology 16(6):321-332.Dunn, Jennifer B.; Newes, Emily; Cai, Hao; Zhang, Yimin; Brooker, Aaron; Ou, Longwen; Mundt, Nicole; Bhatt, Arpit; Peterson, Steve; Biddy, Mary, Energy, economic, and environmental benefits assessment of co-optimized engines and bio-blendstocks, Energy and Environmental Science 13(8):2262-2274.Ledo, Alicia; Hillier, Jonathan; Smith, Pete; Aguilera, Eduardo; Blagodatskiy, Sergey; Brearley, Francis Q.; Datta, Ashim; Diaz-Pines, Eugenio; Don, Axel; Dondini, Marta; Dunn, Jennifer Marie; Feliciano, Diana Marisa; Liebig, Mark A.; Lang, Rong; Llorente, Mireia; Zinn, Yuri Lopes; McNamara, Niall; Ogle, Stephen; Qin, Zhangcai; Rovira, Pere; Rowe, Rebecca; Vicente-Vicente, Jos Luis; Whitaker, Jeanette; Yue, Qian; Zerihun, Ayalsew, A global, empirical, harmonised dataset of soil organic carbon changes under perennial crops, Scientific Data 6(1).Ou, Longwen; Cai, Hao; Seong, Hee Je; Longman, Douglas E.; Dunn, Jennifer B.; Storey, John M.E.; Toops, Todd J.; Pihl, Josh A.; Biddy, Mary; Thornton, Matthew, Co-optimization of Heavy-Duty Fuels and Engines, Environmental Science and Technology 53(21):12904-12913.Chen, Qining; Dunn, Jennifer B.; Allen, David T., Aggregation and Allocation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Oil and Gas Production, ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering 7(20):17065-17073.
