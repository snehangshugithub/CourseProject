Research Interests My research field is theoretical fluid dynamics and especially the application of asymptotic methods to atmosphere and ocean fluid dynamics. These fluid systems are characterized by a vast range of interacting dynamical processes, and mathematical theory plays a crucial role in helping to understand the behaviour of these systems over the long time scales that are relevant to climate dynamics. I find the nonlinear interplay between waves and vortices particularly interesting, so much so that I wrote a book on the topic. Fluid dynamics comprises many mathematical ideas that are also useful in other fields such as quantum mechanics or the study of random processes such as continuous particle diffusion, and I am interested in these fields as well.
