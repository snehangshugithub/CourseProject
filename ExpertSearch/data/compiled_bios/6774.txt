We use MEMS technology and micromachining to fabricate various form of cantilevers with integrated sensors and actuators. These instruments are capable of resolving atomic structure when operating in a vacuum, but primarily they are used in ambient atmosphere to image nanoscale structures. In our current program we are using these instruments to fabricate nanoscale devices. In a parallel theme we are employing these tools to study properties of biological molecules.
