Varghese Professor Director of the Center for Aeromechanics Research Ernest H. Cockrell Centennial Chair in Engineering Department Research Areas: Aerothermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics Education:Ph.D., Stanford University Research Interests: Laser Based Sensors Flow Diagnostics Nonequilibrium and Hypersonic Flows Dr. Varghese teaches courses in Aerothermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics. His research is based on understanding the basic molecular processes occurring in engineering systems which requires a combination of physics and chemistry with traditional fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and thermodynamics. His experimental work is focused on optical diagnostics especially laser-based measurements. His computational work involves the study of rarefied flows using direct simulation Monte Carlo methods and numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation. His research is applied to the study of propulsion, plasmas, hypersonic flows, planetary science, and rarefied atmospheres. He has served on the Cockrell School of Engineering faculty since 1983 and has published nearly 200 technical articles and reports and is co-inventor on six patents related to Raman spectroscopy. Dr. Varghese is a University of Texas Distinguished Teaching Professor.
