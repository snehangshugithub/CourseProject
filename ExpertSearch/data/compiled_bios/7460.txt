Served as Chair of Research Council Awards Committee Served as Member of ASNT Board of Directors Served as Chair of ASNT Executive Committee Served as Chair of ASNT University Programs Committee Served as Chair of ASNT Research Council Teaching Statement Professor Reis has taught courses in nondestructive testing and evaluation, advanced strength of materials, structural mechanics, structure dynamics, steel structures, theory of elasticity, plastic analysis/design of structures, mechanical and structural component design, and graphics. Professor Reis enjoys teaching and the interaction with students. Research Statement Professor Reis current research interests are in the following areas: sensor development, nondestructive testing and evaluation of infrastructure, structural health monitoring, materials characterization, quality control inspection methods in manufacturing and construction, machine and process condition monitoring, mechanics of composite materials and design of composite structures, and design for inspectability. He has particular interests in on-line process control of engineered wood, concrete, corrosion in reinforced concrete, safety glass, decay in wooden structural components, and damage in dimension stone. He is also interested in the quality control of tires and in the detection and assessment of damage (including incipient damage) caused by high temperature hydrogen attack is carbon steels. Motivated by the decay of the US infrastructure, he redirected his attention to nondestructive evaluation of infrastructure. Recently, he has focused his attention on the nondestructive evaluation of asphalt concrete pavements by developing new methods that can be used for better pavement management. These efforts involve characterization of asphalt concrete mixtures, including reusable asphalt pavement (RAP) and reusable asphalt shingles (RAS). He is also working on methods to estimate the levels of oxidative aging of pavements towards pavement prognosis and sustainability, end the effectiveness of rejuvenators.Professor Reis is developing rapid and inexpensive methods for the assessment of existing conditions and maintenance scheduling for pavement systems involving asphalt concrete surfaces. The methods must be able to trigger the rehabilitation time for virtually any pavement surface highway or airfield, in cold or warm climate, and in low- or high-traffic.

Teaching Honors FIELD OF CONCENTRATION IN NONDESTRUCTIVE TESTING AND EVALUATION -- The existence of the NDT&E Laboratory has made it possible to establish a field of concentration in NDT&E for the students to integrate the principles of NDT&E into their design curricula in order to learn how to design for inspectability. A typical secondary field of concentration consists of the following courses: GE 412-Fundamentals of Nondestructive Evaluation (3 or 4 hrs); GE 393-Special problems in NDT&E (3 hrs), where students spend one semester addressing a NDT&E problem in the Laboratory; GE 334-Introduction to Reliability Engineering (3 hrs); and another course in signal processing, robotics, or material behavior (3 hrs). The University of Illinois is one of a very small number of Universities where students can incorporate nondestructive testing into their design curricula. Professor Reis' teaching contributions in the area of design should also be emphasized. The track record of Professor Reis in undergraduate and graduate design courses is clear evidence of his dedication to teaching and his ability to lead students to perform their best in this area. This is demonstrated by the number of national and Departmental awards that were given to Professor Reis' students for their design projects. While a book was recommended as the main text for the course, no textbook is currently available to use in the course. The material taught in this course was compiled from current literature, i.e., papers, handbooks, and other sources such as specialized technical reports in different topics. Professor Reis established a Graduate course GE 412 - Fundamentals of Nondestructive Evaluation at the level of seniors-first year graduate students. To professor Reis knowledge, there are only three other similar courses in the US and they are all different from one another. This course is also different from the others in the sense that it emphasizes applications to industry and incorporation on NDT&E in the design process.
