He is also the Canada Research Chair in Biomanufacturing. Professor Chens research is at the interface of materials, biomedicine and energy. It involves the application of physical chemistry, surface thermodynamics, solid state physics, biochemistry and molecular cell biology to biomedical and chemical engineering systems. He aims to design and measure the molecular interaction, nanostructure formation and adsorption kinetics of peptides, DNA, Small Interfering RNA (siRNA), proteins, surfactants and polymers in solution or at interfaces. The research applies techniques emerging from innovations in nanotechnology, genomics, proteomics and nano/microelectronics to issues found in nanomedicine, biomaterials, colloid and surface science. Practical applications of Professor Chens research include drug and gene delivery; peptide-DNA/RNA binding; protein-lipid interactions, lipid bilayer and cell membrane actions; therapeutic lung surfactants; and emulsification, coating, painting, and thin films. His research also applies to surface mass and heat transfer; molecular/microsensors; nanotube membranes and bioseparation; biofuel cells; molecular sensing and nanocellular foaming of polymers. Professor Chens lab has significantly impacted the success of many emerging energy, biomedical and chemical technologies. His research has also resulted in the creation of a start-up company that works with nano-peptide technology. In addition to Professor Chens research work, he is the author and co-author of over 240 refereed journal publications. He has also written Molecular Interfacial Phenomena of Polymers and Biopolymers, as well as numerous book chapters.Research InterestsNanotechnology & NanomedicineBiochemical & BiomedicalSeparation ProcessesSurfaces and InterfacesPhysical ChemistryThermodynamicsDrug and Gene Delivery (siRNA and anticancer)MicroscopyInterfacial PhenomenaColloids & Porous MediaEnergyMaterials ScienceSurface ThermodynamicsSolid State PhysicsAdditive ManufacturingWaterEducation1998, Doctorate, Mechanical Engineering, University of Toronto1993, Master's, Materials Science, University of Toronto1988, Bachelor of Science (BSc), Materials Science, Nanjing University1985, Bachelor's, Physics, Nanjing UniversityCourses*CHE 231 - Physical Chemistry 2Taught in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019CHE 612 - Interfacial PhenomenaTaught in 2016CHE 755 - Res Tpcs in Electrochem.
