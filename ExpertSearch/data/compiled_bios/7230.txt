Mechanical Engineering, MIT, Cambridge, MA B.S. Mathematics, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN B.S. Interdisciplinary Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, INResearch InterestsProf. Johnson is internationally known for his work on ocular biomechanics, particular with regards to the pathogenesis of glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. Studies in his group currently involve a bioengineering approach that utilize perfusion studies, atomic force microscopy and theoretical analysis in combination with use of high-resolution morphometry and finite element modeling. He has been involved in the study of a variety of physiological transport and mechanics problems for the past 30 years including flow through the aqueous humor outflow pathways as relates to glaucoma, transport and mechanics of the arterial wall, transport through the cornea, transport through macromolecular gels such as hyaluronic acid and Matrigel, transport through Bruchs membrane and cell mechanics.Courses TaughtBME 377: Intermediate Fluid Mechanics.

All of his courses focus on this engineering skill. In collaboration with Professor Ross Ethier of Georgia Tech, he is publishing a book (through Cambridge University Press) on flow and transport problems that emphasizes these skills.
