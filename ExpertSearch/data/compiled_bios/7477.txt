I received an M.Sc. degree in mathematics from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in 1975, a Diploma in engineering from the ENST in Paris in 1977, and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from Brown in 1980. From 1980 to June 1991, I was a researcher with the French CNRS in Paris. I have been at Brown since 1991, as a visiting professor until 2000, and then as an associate professor of applied mathematics and neuroscience. Brown Affiliations Applied Mathematics Neuroscience Research Areas artificial vision | brain code | computational linguistics | computational neuroscience | computational vision | computer vision | neural representation | part-of-speech tagging | theoretical neuroscience Research Research Overview My research is in theoretical neuroscience, computational vision, and computational linguistics. I study the mechanisms used by brains to create and work with complex, detailed, hierarchical representations of the external world. With colleagues in neuroscience and applied math, I investigate the hypothesis that the fine temporal structure of cortical activity, e.g. the synchronous firing of neurons, plays an important role in these representations. Research Statement COMPUTATIONAL VISION My main research is in computational vision, natural and artificial. To interpret visual scenes, our brains rely on complex computations across a number of hierarchical levels. In particular, when interpreting images that are locally ambiguous as is most often the case our brains bring high-level knowledge to bear on low-level tasks such as image segmentation. In collaboration with neuroscientists, I investigate the neural mechanisms underlying such computations. In collaboration with applied mathematicians, I investigate generative compositional hierarchical models inspired by my work in theoretical neuroscience. COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS I have recently begun to work in the field of computational linguistics. I currently focus on the task of unsupervised learning of part-of-speech tags.
