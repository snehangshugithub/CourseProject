Since graduating, he has been a Postdoctoral Associate in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems at MIT and a member of the Future Urban Mobility group of the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART). His research focus at MIT has been on the analysis and control of networked cyber-physical systems with applications to Mobility-on-Demand.Samitha received his bachelors degree in Computer Science (with a minor in Economics) and an M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science both from MIT, and an M.Sc. in Management Science and Engineering (Operations Research) from Stanford University. He has worked in the database backup and recovery group at Oracle Corporation, the design for test (DFT) group at Synopsys Inc., the transit algorithms team at Google and the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control (INRIA). He is a recipient of the Dwight David Eisenhower Graduate Fellowship awarded by the U.S. Department of Transportation.Research InterestsSamitha's research interests are in the analysis and control of networked cyber-physical systems with a focus on transportation and other urban infrastructure systems. In particular, he's interested in enabling efficient and sustainable urban transportation systems, by utilizing advances in information technology (e.g. the proliferation of smart phones and real-time communication), mathematical modeling and optimization, and new transportation paradigms such as mobility-on-demand systems. His research develops and utilizes mathematical tools from the areas of dynamic programming, stochastic network optimization, multi-commodity flow optimization and network load balancing.TransportationComplex Systems, Network Science and ComputationAlgorithmsTransportation Systems EngineeringResearch Group MembersSelected PublicationsNiknami, M., Samitha Samaranayake.2016."Tractable Pathnding for the Stochastic On-Time Arrival Problem."SIAM Meeting on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX)-in review."Spieser, K., S.
