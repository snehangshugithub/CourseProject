Previously I worked in combinatorial group theory, and I still keep some interest there. At the moment I am also actively exploring certain areas in discrete mathematics, notably extremal combinatorics; for more detailed description see the bottom of the page http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~razborov/teaching/index.html.
