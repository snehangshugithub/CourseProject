Dr. Gehrke received his PhD degree in anatomy and developmental genetics from the school of medicine at Case Western Reserve University and then did postdoctoral training in the Biology Department at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has been a member of the MIT and Harvard faculties since 1982.Professor Gehrkes primary teaching responsibility is directing course HT-010, Functional Human Anatomy, which is part of the core HST MD curriculum. degrees PhD in Anatomy and Developmental Genetics, Case Western Reserve University, 1980 MA (Honorary) Harvard University BS in Zoology, Eastern Illinois University selected awards/societies American Society for Virology American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology The American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) College of Fellows Class of 2021 research Professor Gehrkes research interests center on molecular aspects of host-pathogen interactions and on the pathogenesis of RNA viruses.Current experimental work focuses on understanding how viruses that are closely related in genetic sequence cause highly variable disease outcomes.Examples include Zika virus, which is correlated with birth defects including microcephaly, and dengue virus, which is in most cases a self-limited disease that does not cause congenital abnormalities. Cerebral organoids grown from NIH-registered human embryonic stem cells or human induced pluripotent stems cells closely mimic the human brain and serve as models for defining virus tropisms (which cells are infected) and subsequent effects on cell growth or cell death.Collaborative work with other IMES faculty permits three-dimensional imaging of virus infections, and single cell sequence analysis distinguishes transcriptional profiles in infected and uninfected cells. selected publications Antonucci J, Gehrke L.

Available from: http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aas8836 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States (PNAS): Genome-wide CRISPR screen for Zika virus resistance in human neural cells Zika virus (ZIKV) is a neurotropic and neurovirulent arbovirus that has severe detrimental impact on the developing human fetal brain. We used a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen to identify ZIKV host genes in human neural progenitors. The screen identified host factors involved in heparan sulfation, endocytosis, endoplasmic reticulum processing, Golgi function, and interferon activity. Our findings provide insights into host-dependent mechanisms for ZIKV infection in the highly vulnerable human neural progenitor cells and identify molecular targets for potential therapeutic intervention.
