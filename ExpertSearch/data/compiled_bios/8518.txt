Joshua Sumpter Home Joshua Sumpter Department of Mathematics University of Rochester Home Teaching About me: I am currently a Visitting Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York. I am currently researching topics in Random Matrix Theory. My primary research interests are in Random Matrix Theory and Mathematical Physics. I recently received my PhD in Mathematics from the University of California, Davis in June 2021. Publications Pair Dependent Linear Statistics for Circular Random Matrix Ensembles My Dissertation. Soon To Appear on Proquest Pair Dependent Linear Statistics for CBE with Alexander Soshnikov and Ander Aguirre. Random Matrices: Theory and Applications Conferences and Workshops Here is a list of some of the conferences and workshops that I have attended. Hopefully there will be many more to come in the near future! 11th Cornell Probability Summer School (June 2019) CRM WorkshopTopic: Spectral Theory of Semi-Periodic and Random Operator (Nov. 2018) International Congress for Mathematical Physics (ICMP) (Aug. 2018) Other Misc. Mathematics Projects: qKZ is a SageMath package that I wrote in Spring 2017. This package generates and impliments operations on wheel polynomials, a family of polynomials studied by Dan Romik in his paper titled "Connectivity patterns in loop percolation I: the rationality phenomenon and constant term identities". This package has two variations: a 'non-threaded' version and a 'threaded' version which uses parallel computing to drastically improve computational performance. This project was inspired by a reading course supervised by Dan in Spring 2017. Address:University of Rochester Mathematics Department 915 Hylan Building P.O.
