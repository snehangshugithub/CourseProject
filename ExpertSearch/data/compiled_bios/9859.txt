This school builds on the strong tradition of interdisciplinary research in IIT Kharagpur. Our multi-disciplinary approach will ensure diverse areas of research that include studies at the level of molecules (biochemistry, biophysics, molecular & structural biology) to organisms (cellular and developmental biology, microbiology and immunology). The overarching goal of this school is to elucidate the structure and function of biological molecules that influence the physiology of an organism, and more importantly apply these basic findings to the discovery of novel therapeutic solutions for various human diseases to enhance human health.We will use state-of-the-art facilities to study biological macromolecules in both normal and diseased states. Biophysical methods such as X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, analytical ultra-centrifugation (AUC) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) will be used to study the molecular and structural basis of macromolecular functions. A few areas of interest are - regulation of transcription factors, DNA repair mechanisms, protein folding and mis-folding, intrinsically disordered proteins, enzyme catalysis and protein engineering.Molecular biology studies will be supported by strong research and training programs in cell biology, developmental biology and genetics. The common themes will include regulation of gene expression, signal transduction, intracellular trafficking, cell cycle and apoptosis, cell polarity and migration, cell-cell interactions, pattern formation and organ development.A major focus of our research is the discovery of therapeutic strategies for various human diseases based on our fundamental molecular and cellular biology research. We will study many important diseases including, but not limited to, cancer, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, heart and respiratory diseases, diabetes and tuberculosis.For further informations please contact biosciences@iitkgp.ac.in Read more > < Read less Message from the Chairperson Prof. Ramkrishna Sen Chairperson of the School Contact (Chairperson) Phone: +91-3222-260515 Fax: +91-3222-255303, 255303 Email : chair-bioschool@iitkgp.ac.in "Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur has long standing interests in research and education at the interface of life science and technology. Considerable amount of interdisciplinary research is underway involving various Departments, Centers and Schools such as Biotechnology, Medical Science & Technology, Advanced Laboratory for Plant Genetic Engineering, Agriculture & Food Engineering, Mechanical/Chemical Engineering as well as the basic science departments of Chemistry and Physics. To integrate these research activities and to give a boost to a comprehensive bioscience oriented education and research, the Institute has recently established a School of Bio Science. This School will add further momentum to the growth of academic and research programs in Cellular and Molecular Biology, Health-care Technology, Computational biology and Drug Design and Delivery and to initiate new research activities in the interdisciplinary areas of bioscience and engineering disciplines. The School has a mandate to produce new breed of trained manpower for educational institutions, R & D organizations and pharmaceutical industries.The School of Bio Science is now housed in the 1st and 2nd floors of the Life Science Building in the Diamond Jubilee Complex. We now have six faculty members and are in the process of recruiting more faculty members in the School. The joint MSc.-PhD (INTPBS) program of IIT Kharagpur and IACS Kolkata has been running very successfully since 2016-17.The PhD program of the School has also been running successfully. Interested students are directed to contact the faculty members of the School."
