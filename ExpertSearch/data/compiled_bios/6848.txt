Mechanical Engineering, University of Queensland, 1991Ph.D. Mechanical Engineering, University of Queensland, 1999 "Oh, that view is tremendous" John Glenn aboard spacecraft Friendship 7, Feb. 20, 1962. Professor Goyne obtained aBachelor of Mechanical Engineering and Ph.D. from the University of Queensland, Australia, in 1991 and 1999, respectively. During his Ph.D. research, Goyne specialized in high-speed aerodynamics, high-speed air-breathing propulsion and instrumentation development. Upon completion of his graduate studies, Goynejoined the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of Virginia as a Research Associate. Here he conducted research in hypersonic propulsion using the University of Virginias unique Supersonic Combustion Facility. This work was funded by NASAs Hyper-X Program. He briefly returned to the University of Queensland to participate in the HyShot scramjet flight test program before joining the faculty at the University of Virginia. Now an Associate Professor and Director of the Aerospace Research Laboratory, he continues his work in hypersonic air-breathing propulsion, supersonic aerodynamics, hypersonic ground and flight test techniques,diagnostic andmeasurement technique development, controls and advanced manufacturing.Goyne also conducts research on the interaction of fluids with rotating machineryin collaboration with the Rotating Machinery and Controls (ROMAC) Industrial Program at the University of Virginia. Goyne is an Associate Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and within this organization is past Chair of the Hypersonic Technology and Aerospace Planes Program Committee. He is also a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. He currently serves as an AssociateEditor for theShock Waves journal. Goyne haslead roleswithin the University Consortium for Applied Hypersonics. As part ofthis organization, he is the International Teaminglead on the Research Engagement Committee and is the Technical AreaCollaboration Co-Lead for air-breathing propulsion. Goyne also serves on the Governor of Virginia's Aerospace Advisory Council and is Chair of theVirginiaSpace Grant ConsortiumAdvisory Council.Hehas reviewed manuscripts for the AIAA Journal, the Journal of Propulsion and Power, the Journal of Aircraft, Experiments in Fluidsandthe Journal of Aerospace Engineering, as well as forAIAA professionalconferences. He has chaired various sessions at international aerospace conferences and participated ininvited panels and lectures. Goyne is currently the Faculty Advisor for the University of Virginia student chapters of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and Sigma Gama Tau.

Because they do not have to carry their own oxidizers, as rockets must, vehicles powered by air-breathing scramjets can be smaller and lighter - or be the same size and carry more payload.
