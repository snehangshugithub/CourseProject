P. Singh joined the physics faculty at UC Davis in 1989. His research activities involve using Statistical Mechanics and Computational Methods to study a variety of problems in theoretical physics. These range from electronic behavior of Solids to protein structure and novel mechanisms in Biological Physics. In the study of Solid State Physics, Professor Singh's work has focused on magnetism and superconductivity, where he has developed and studied statistical models that exhibit exotic and novel paradigms of cooperative many-body behavior: for example, novel quantum phases and phase transitions, novel excitations, and novel mechanisms of order and disorder. He also uses a variety of computational and analytical techniques to study mechanisms of High Temperature Superconductivity in cuprates, iron pnictides and other materials. In Biological Physics, Professor Singh's work has focused on such questions as: Can DNA act as a Molecular Wire and play a role in repairing damage? and, what causes certain proteins to misfold and aggregate inside the cell leading to such debilitating diseases as Alzheimers and Prion disease? His group seeks to model these phenomena at various levels of coarse-graining from the molecular to the cellular levels.
