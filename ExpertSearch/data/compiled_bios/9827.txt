Krovi is the Michelin Endowed Chair of Vehicle Automation in the Departments of Automotive Engineering and Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University. He received his Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics from the University ofPennsylvania in 1998. The underlying theme of his research activities has been to take advantage of the power of the many (both autonomous-agents and humans)to extend the reach of human users in the dull, dirty, and dangerous environments. These efforts at analyzing and realizing the potential of distributed-autonomy and human-robot synergy has unlocked new opportunities in wide ranging applications in plant-automation,consumer electronics, automobile, defense and healthcare/surgical simulation arenas. The principal opportunities lie in building upon heterogeneous loosely-interconnected physical- and information-systems and architecting high-confidence and reconfigurable operational capabilities in the presence of uncertainties. The adopted research approach blends both design and control techniques to achieve system-level performance that far exceed the achievable capabilities of individual components. The lifecycletreatment approach (design, modeling, analysis, control, implementation andverification) of novel robotic and mechatronic systems, places emphasis on both the theoretical formulation and experimental validation. His work has been funded by NSF, DARPA, ARO as well as numerous state and industrial grants and has received multiple awards,including theNational Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award, Petro-CanadaYoung Innovator Award, several best poster, conference and journal paper awards. His work has been published in more than 200 journal/conference articles and book chapters, and patents. He has taken significant leadership roles in robotics research and education within multiple professional societies. Within the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), leadership included roles in the Design Materials and Manufacturing (DMM) Segment Leadership Team (~25000 members) and the Chair of the Mechanisms and Robotics Committee. Within the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, he serves on the Executive Committee (ExCom) of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (~30000 members) and has previously served on the Conference Activities Board (CAB) and Industrial Activities Board (IAB) He isan active executive organizing committee member for many ASME and IEEE conferences. Most recently, he served as General Chair of the 2014 ASME International Design Engineering TechnicalConferences (IDETC14) and as Finance Chair of IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation(CASE10, ICRA12, IROS14 and ICRA19). He currently serves as the Editor-in-Chief of the ASME Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics. He has served as an Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Robotics, ASME Dynamic Systems Magazine, ASME Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics, ASME Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement and Control, IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics, and the Springer Journal of Intelligent Service Robotics.
