Physics, Bombay University, 1990M.S. Physics, Bombay University, 1992Ph.D. Physics, Bhabha Atomic Research Center, 1998 "To develop quantitative cardiac PET imaging techniques to address metabolic remodeling in small animal models of myocardial injury & type 2 diabetes." Bijoy Kumar Kundu, Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering Bijoy K. Kundu, PhD, is an Associate Professor in the tenure track in the department of Radiology and Medical Imaging at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville. After completing his PhD in Nuclear Physics from the Bhabha Atomic Research Center, India, he pursued his post-doctoral work at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India. He then moved to the Department of Radiology, University of Virginia, as a post-doctoral associate and moved up the faculty ranks. Dr. Kundu is a member of many scientific societies and reviewer of a number of peer-reviewed journals. The goals of his lab are to develop and optimize quantitative cardiac PET imaging techniquesto address the hypothesis of metabolic remodeling in small animal modelsof myocardial injury and type 2 diabetes. His lab is currently funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health.
