Our TrEnCh (Translating Environmental Change) Projectis a branch of the group focused on building computational and visualization tools to understand how organisms experience climate change. We practice open science, so you can track our progress in ourresearch groupand TrEnCh Project GitHub organizations. You can find lab policies and resources here. Research Question How does biology (morphology, physiology, and life history) determine an organisms ecological and evolutionary response to environmental change? Approaches Ecological and evolutionary forecasting and hindcasting: We are using historic data on species traits from museum specimens and performance from lab and field studies to assess phenotypic shifts and their influence on species responses to recent climate change. Mechanistic models of species ranges in changing environments: We develop mechanistic models that scale from individual performance and energetics to population and community dynamics and predict abundance and distribution patterns. Physiological, energetic, and ecological constraints on abundance, distribution, and diversity: Ecoinformatics enables us to ask how the evolution of physiological traits constrains broad-scale patterns of abundance, distribution, and diversity. Outreach and Education: We develop computational tools to translate physical climate changes into impacts on organisms. The tools enable assessing the ecological consequences of given warming. We also teach courses on physiological and global change ecology and evolution and participate in outreach activities aimed at disseminating information about the ecological impacts of climate change.

Nufio@CesarNufio19 NovWe just released our short film on the science of climate change! Our goal was to develop a valuable classroom resource on the topic. The film highlights the incredible work of Crystal Kolden, Asmeret Asefaw Berhe, Ralph Keeling and Kathleen Wendt. https://www.biointeractive.org/classroom-resources/science-climate-changeReply on Twitter 1461710025928413188Retweet on Twitter 14617100259284131882Like on Twitter 14617100259284131888Twitter 1461710025928413188lauren buckley@ecolforecaster27 OctWhat a great idea and opportunity. Hope to see the group in the field. EmeryLab@EmeryLabIm very excited work with @LterNiwot to make grad school, field biology, and alpine science more accessible to students through FIRED UP!
