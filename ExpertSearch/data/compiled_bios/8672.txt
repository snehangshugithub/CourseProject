Earls Professor Civil and Environmental Engineering Hollister Hall, Room 365 607/255-1652earls@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyEarls' research involves the development and application of new computational techniques for the study of important problems involving solids and structures, as well as other natural and engineered systems. Coupling the principled treatment of uncertainty with these computational approaches facilitates the solution of complex inverse problems. Such inverse problems arise naturally as part of Earls' research. Earls is a member of the United States Association for Computational Mechanics (USACM), the International Association on Computational Mechanics (IACM), and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM).Research InterestsEarls' Group is concerned with developing novel algorithmic and computational approaches that enable new understanding concerning the actual condition, and future behavior of complex natural and engineered systems. Practical challenges concerning the principled treatment of uncertainty, sparse sensing, and the complex multi-physics response modalities of the real-world are motivational in our work. The intellectual themes that underpin our research are: computational mechanics, high performance computing, and applied mathematics. Problems of interest to us occur in the domains of engineering and applied science.Computer Aided DiagnosisComputational MechanicsComputational Solid MechanicsScientific ComputingComplex Systems, Network Science and ComputationStructural EngineeringTeaching InterestsEarls' teaching focus is on undergraduate design of metal structures and structural mechanics, as well as computational mechanics at the graduate level.Service InterestsEarls is a member of the United States Association for Computational Mechanics, the International Association on Computational Mechanics, and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.Selected PublicationsEarls, Christopher J., R.
