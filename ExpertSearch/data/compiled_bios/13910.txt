Ringel Assistant Professor of Biology Alison E. Ringel seeks to understand the molecular adaptations that enable immune cells to function and survive within unfavorable environments. aringel@mit.edu Email Education PhD, 2015, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine BA, 2009, Molecular Biology & Biochemistry/Physics, Wesleyan University Research Summary We investigate crosstalk between CD8+ T cells and their environment at a molecular level, by dissecting thebiological and metabolic programs engaged under conditions of stress. Using an array of approaches to model and perturb the local microenvironment, our research aims to revealboth the adaptive molecular changes as well as intrinsic vulnerabilities in T cells that arise within the tumor niche. Our goal is to understand how disease states remodel the fundamental mechanisms that regulate immune cell function and contribute to pathogenesis. Alison Ringel will open her lab in early 2022.
