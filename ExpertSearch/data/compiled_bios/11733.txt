Acton Professor, Electrical and Computer EngineeringProfessor, Biomedical Engineering (By Courtesy) Home Find Faculty Scott T. Acton Bio B.S. Electrical Engineering, Virginia Tech, 1988M.S. Electrical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, 1990Ph.D. Electrical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, 1993 Professor Actons laboratory at UVA is called VIVA - Virginia Image and Video Analysis. They specialize in biological image analysis problems. The research emphases of VIVA include tracking, segmentation, representation, retrieval, classification and enhancement. Professor Acton has over 275 publications in the image analysis area. His recent professional service includes Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing and General Co-Chair of the IEEE International Symposisum on Biomedical Imaging. Awards IEEE Fellow 2013 Faculty Innovation Award 2017 All-University Teaching Award 2009 Outstanding Young Electrical Engineer 1996 Research Interests Signal and Image Processing In the News UVA Brain Discovery Could Block Agings Terrible Toll on the Mind UVA Brain Discovery Could Block Agings Terrible Toll on the Mind Acton lab collaborates with Kipnis lab Aging vessels connecting the brain and the immune system play critical roles in both Alzheimers disease and the decline in cognitive ability that comes with time, new research reveals. By improving the function of the lymphatic vessels, scientists at the University of Virginia School of Medicine have dramatically enhanced aged mices ability to learn and improved their memories. The work may provide doctors an entirely new path to treat or prevent Alzheimers disease, age-related memory loss and other neurodegenerative diseases. The research is the latest from the lab of pioneering neuroscientist Jonathan Kipnis, whose team discovered in 2015 that the brain is surrounded by lymphatic vessels vessels science textbooks insisted did not exist.

It took them less than an hour to outline several exciting projects that could apply Professor Actons biomedical imaging analysis techniques to Dr. Kipnis groundbreaking work on the newly discovered lymphatic system in the brain. The identification of the brains lymphatic systemwhich was once unknownis one of the largest and surprising discoveries in modern medicine. And although Kipnis discovery is exciting enough, its just the beginning. Research into this newfound area promises to help solve the mysteries of devastating neuro-immune disorders like Alzheimers and autism that are still incurable. One of the main components in researching brain immune disorders is getting quantifiable data that answers basic but essential questions about what causes change in the brain. Such changes may be due to a drug, an environment, or a gene. Thats where biomedical image analysis becomes crucial, because it can measure minute changes in the brains complex components, such as neurons, parts of neurons, and connective tissue, and start to get answers. Ultimately, through a bold venture known as embedding, Acton joined Kipnis team to begin the journey of charting nothing less than a new frontier of the human brain.
