Following a brief stint at UC Berkeley, he moved to UC Santa Barbara to continue his postdoc. He joined the faculty at UIUC in 2016. His professional awards include the Ryan Fellowship, 3M Fellowship, AkzoNobel award, ACS Petroleum Research Fund Doctoral New Investigator award, and a 3M Non-tenured faculty award. Education 2013, PhD, Northwestern University 2008, Bachelor of Chemical Engineering, University of Minnesota 2008, Bachelor ofScience in Chemistry, University of Minnesota Research Interests Polymer Physics, Diffusion, Energy Materials, Nanoscale and Interfacial Physics Research Statement The Evans group is interested in probing the physics of polymer networks with the incorporation of dynamic covalent bonds and added salts. We are pursuing a fundamental understanding of polymer properties such as energy dissipation, self-healing, crystallization, and transport of small molecules through the network. The group combines molecular design of precise polymers with advanced characterization approaches to determine structure-property relationships in dynamic, ionic networks. Application of networks in the group include supercapacitors, actuators, membranes, batteries, and shockwave dissipating polymers which are informed by our fundamental investigations.
