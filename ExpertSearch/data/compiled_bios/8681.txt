Warner Associate Professor Civil and Environmental Engineering Hollister Hall, Room 373 607/255-7155 Associate Director of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Director of Undergraduate Studies dhw52@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyDerek Warner joined the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering in October 2007. Prior to this he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Division of Engineering at Brown University, where he worked in the Mechanics of Solids Group. He completed his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University in 2006. During the 2013 and 2020 academic years, Derek was a Visiting Professor at the cole polytechnique fdrale de Lausanne in Switzerland.Research InterestsDerek is the director of the Cornell Fracture Group. For the majority of his academic career, he has worked with the US Navy to illuminate and model the underlying mechanisms that control the failure of structural materials, with the ultimate objective of advancing the capability to predict the deformation and failure of structures by utilizing new knowledge and modeling techniques. Since 2013 Derek has worked with the Navy to better understand and predict the performance of additively manufactured metallic components. His toolset includes: long timescale atomistic techniques (FTS, TIS), atomistic to continuum concurrent multiscale techniques (QM-CADD), the utilization of machine learning interatomic potentials, micromechanical modeling (large deformations, remeshing, microstructural modeling), and component scale fabrication, post processing, and failure modeling with probabilistic frameworks and FRANC3D crack growth software. He has directed and analyzed X-ray CT, EBSD, confocal laser microscopy, and fatigue testing.Scientific ComputingAdvanced Materials ProcessingAdvanced MaterialsEnergy and the EnvironmentNanotechnologyStatistical Mechanics and Molecular SimulationComputational MechanicsComputational Solid MechanicsStructural EngineeringTeaching InterestsSolid Mechanics, Nonlinear Finite Element Analysis, Additive Manufacturing for Load Bearing Applications, Deformation and Failure Mechanisms, Scientific SupercomputingService InterestsDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Civil Engineering, Chair of College Common Curriculum Governing Board, Junior Faculty MentorSelected PublicationsW.
