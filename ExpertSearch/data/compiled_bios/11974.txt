She integrates field-based system analyses and experimental laboratory work to define and predict anthropogenic impacts on aquatic greenhouse dynamics from local and regional to global scale. Contact informationOffice: Phone: Email: tonya.delsontro@uwaterloo.ca Expertise Greenhouse gas dynamics of inland waters Quantification of methane ebullition (bubbling) Upscaling aquatic greenhouse gas and carbon emissions Anthropogenic impacts on climatic feedback of inland waters Hydropower reservoirs in the global carbon cycle Lake sediment greenhouse gas dynamic Research Professor DelSontros research interests lie in understanding how anthropogenic impacts, such as eutrophication, influence integrated greenhouse gas (CO2+CH4+N2O) budgets in lakes, rivers and reservoirs. She aims to define the drivers of budget shifts and use them to better asses the vulnerability of other regions to human-induced changes in aquatic greenhouse gas dynamics. As the global warming potential of these gases vary, shifts in budget could lead to an exacerbation or an easing of climate change. Understanding our role in the climatic impact of inland waters will guide us in creating climate-friendly policies when managing our waterways.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
