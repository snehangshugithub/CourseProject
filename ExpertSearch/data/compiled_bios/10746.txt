Hons. in Chemistry, University of the Witwatersrand, 1987 About Pier Doctoral Dissertation Chiral Allylic Silanes in Organic Synthesis: Formal Synthesis of (+)-Sesbanimide A. Doctorate in Philosophy. Boston University, 1995 Research Interests Before joining the faculty at the University of New Haven, I spent twelve years in medicinal chemistry research at a pharmaceutical company, designing and synthesizing kinase inhibitors and receptor modulators that have the potential to treat inflammatory diseases. My current research interest is the laboratory synthesis of: natural products and their analogs, polyoxygenated compounds, and heterocyclic compounds. The motivation is to discover, in collaboration with biochemists, new compounds of potential medicinal interest such as antibiotics and anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Special consideration is given to new, efficient, and green methods of synthesis.
