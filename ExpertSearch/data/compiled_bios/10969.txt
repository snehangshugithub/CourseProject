Mukund Rangamani Mukund Rangamani Skip to content Home Research The AdS/CFT correspondence String Theory Teaching Home I am a theoretical physicist, specializing in areas of string theory, quantum field theory, quantum gravity, and quantum information working at theDepartment of PhyicsatUC, Davis. I am also part of the newCenter for Quantum Mathematics and Physics (QMAP). This is an exciting development with focus on bringing together researchers interested in a wide range of topics in theoretical physics. Research My main area of research interest is in the field ofString theory, especially its applications to Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Gravity. Much of my work has focussed on using theAdS/CFT correspondenceboth to learn new lessons about quantum gravity and to model strongly interacting quantum field dynamics. My current interests include: Entanglement, quantum information, and holography Hydrodynamics and non-equilibrium dynamics You can find more information about my current research interests in myResearchpages. More usefully, you can find my research papers using the INSPIRE HEP search engine:Publication List. If you are interested in the AdS/CFT correspondence and Entanglement entropy, you may find the recent book I co-authored with Tadashi Takayanagi, Holographicentanglement entropy, a useful reference. For further details see myAdS/CFT correspondencepages. Teaching In (202122) I am teaching PHY 215A: Graduate Quantum Mechanics (Fall) PHY 232:Topics in String Theory (Winter) PHY 9HB: Honors Physics: Special Relativity & Statistical Thermodynamics (Winter) Find more information about my courses in my Teaching pages.
