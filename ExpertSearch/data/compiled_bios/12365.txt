Research Summary The Sive lab probes molecular mechanisms underlying vertebrate development. They focus on the Extreme Anterior Domain, a facial signaling center that also forms the mouth. They examine the brain ventricular system and basal constriction, a novel cell shape change in the brain. They also focus on neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, and epilepsy, in order to define novel therapeutics. In June 2020, Professor Sive moved to become Dean of Science and Professor of Biology at Northeastern University. She is actively accepting postdoctoral fellows into her lab.
