People Dr Borzoo Rassouli People Dr Borzoo Rassouli Lecturer School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CSEE) Email b.rassouli@essex.ac.uk Location 5B.521, Colchester Campus Profile Teaching and supervision Publications Contact Profile Teaching and supervision Publications Contact Profile Biography I received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from university of Tehran, Iran in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree in communications engineering from Imperial College London, UK in 2016. I was a postdoctoral research associate at Imperial College from 2016 to 2018. In August 2018, I joined university of Essex as a lecturer (Assistant Professor). My research interests lie in the general areas of information theory and statistics.
