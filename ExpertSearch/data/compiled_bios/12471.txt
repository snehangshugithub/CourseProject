Biography: Brady Gibbons is a professor of materials science in the School of Mechanical, Industrial, & Manufacturing Engineering at Oregon State University. He is also the co-director of Oregon State's Materials Synthesis and Characterization Institute. His research specializes in structure-process-property relationships in multifunctional thin film materials. His group focuses on processing, novel instrumentation development, and integration science; new dielectric, superconducting, semiconducting, and pyroelectric materials for energy conversion and energy storage; ferroelectric and piezoelectric thin films for microelectromechanical systems; scanning probe and x-ray diffraction characterization methods; and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Specifically, he is interested in developing novel integration science strategies to combine material functionalities that result in significantly enhanced, or even new, properties. He has advised or co-advised 20 graduate students at Oregon State, along with several others in his previous position. He has nine patents/patent applications and over 60 peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers. He is a 2012 NSF CAREER awardee. Prior to Oregon State he spent eight years at Los Alamos National Laboratory as a postdoctoral researcher and member of the technical staff. There, his research on 2nd generation superconducting wire led to an R&D 100 Award in 2004. He received his Ph.D. in Materials Science from the Pennsylvania State University in 1998. He has been at OSU since 2006.
