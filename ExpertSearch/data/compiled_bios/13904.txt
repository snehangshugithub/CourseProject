Yilmaz Associate Professor of Biology Omer H. Yilmaz explores the impact of dietary interventions on stem cells, the immune system, and cancer within the intestine. 617-324-7633 Phone 76-553G Office ohyilmaz@mit.edu Email Lab Website Elizabeth Galoyan Assistant 617-253-3016 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 2008, University of Michigan; MD, 2008, University of Michigan Medical School BS, 1999, Biochemistry and Physics, University of Michigan Research Summary The adult intestine is maintained by stem cells that require a cellular neighborhood, or niche, consisting in part of Paneth cells. Our laboratory will investigate the molecular mechanisms of how intestinal stem cells and their Paneth cell niche respond to diverse diets to coordinate intestinal regeneration with organismal physiology and its impact on the formation and growth of intestinal cancers. By better understanding how intestinal stem cells adapt to diverse diets, we hope to identify and develop new strategies that prevent and reduce the growth of cancers involving the intestinal tract that includes the small intestine, colon, and rectum.
