The word "quantum" in the sense of my research means non-commutative generalizations of mathematical objects that are usually described by commutative algebras. Quantum probability is the study of non-commutative algebras and random variables, quantum groups are like Lie groups but with non-commuting coordinates, etc. I also have non-quantum results and interests in geometry and combinatorics, some of them inspired by quantum mathematics.
