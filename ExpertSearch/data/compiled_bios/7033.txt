Not sure what to do next, I was lucky to get to work and play in Hawai'i for two years, training dolphins at a research lab and managing a fish hatchery research facility. Although that experience was life-changing, I yearned to be back in academia so came to the UW for graduate school. I completed my PhD in 2000 in the lab of Dr. Sandra Bajjalieh, where I studied the interactions of synaptic vesicle proteins and their function in neurotransmitter release. My scientific interests include: neurobiology and behavior, gene regulation, neurolinguistics, animal behavior, the intersection of lifestyle and disease, and invertebrate physiology and ecology as well as the study of women's work-life balance. Teaching history: During graduate school I fell in love with teaching. I was lucky to work with some amazing mentors, including Dr. Bonny Brewer, Dr. Bill Moody, Dr. Linda Martin-Morris, Dr. Mosur Raghuraman and Ms. Allie Rudkin. I have worked as a Lecturer for the Department of Genome Sciences (2001-2007) and the Department of Biology (2008-present). In 2014 I was promoted to Senior Lecturer, and in 2020 we got title changes and now I'm an Associate Teaching Professor! I continue to enjoy teaching, feeling that it is an honor to come to work each day in such an amazing learning environment. I also enjoy helping undergraduates navigate their path to careers in science. Courses I often teach: Bio 200/240 - Introductory Biology Bio 380 - Biomedical Advances and Society Bio 400 - Experiments in Molecular Biology Bio 401 - Advanced Cell Biology Bio 434 - Invertebrate Zoology Bio 466 - Pathobiology of Emerging Diseases GenSt 197 - The Origin of Life (Collegium Seminar for Freshmen) Courses I have taught in the past: Biology 355 - Foundations in Cell and Molecular Biology Biology 350 - Foundations in Physiology Genome 261 - Genomes and Society Genome 371 - Introductory Genetics Genome 351 - Human Genetics Genome 475 - Debates in Genetics Personal Interests: I am the mother of two daughters (18 and 13) who keep me busy and active! As a family we are involved in the adoption community, the transgender community and foster animal care. My hobbies include playing volleyball, swimming and reading.
