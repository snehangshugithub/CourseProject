University of Strathclyde, United Kingdom, 1986Ph.D. University of Strathclyde, United Kingdom, 1990Post-Doc E.L. Ginzton Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 1990-1992 "Ultrasound is unique in that it provides for both imaging and therapy. In fact, it is possible to use real-time imaging to guide therapy as it happens. It is also the most widely available imaging modality." John A. Hossack, Professor John A. Hossack develops ultrasound imaging approaches for cardiovascular disease, including mouse heart imaging, catheter-based imaging and drug delivery, and molecular imaging for diagnosing stroke risk. He obtained B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Strathclyde, UK, and id his postdoc at Stanford University in the E. L. Ginzton Laboratory for two years. Afterwards, Dr. Hossack worked in industry at Acuson, a leading designer and manufacturer of advanced ultrasound imaging equipment in Mountain View, CA for seven years. Since 2000, he has been anAssociate Professor, then Professor, of Biomedical Engineering, (Electrical and Computer Engineering 2006) at the University of Virginia. He has background in both the academic and industry setting and has been involved in, to a varying degree,three startup companies--each of which has been successful. Curent projects include: Molecular imaging using molecular targeted microbubble-based contrast agents. Ultrasound provides for single particle (single microbubble) imaging sensitivity. When we can detect a microbubble that has adhered to a selected molecular receptor, we have detected the signature of disease at a molecular level. Thus, we can detect disease at the earliest possible stage. The foremost applications are in cardiovascular disease and cancer. Our laboratory is primarily interested in developing new signal processing methods for detecting the signal associated with a molecular (ligand-receptor)bound microbubble with high sensitivity and high specificity in real-time. Catheter-based ultrasound imaging and drug delivery. We are also investigatingdrug delivery to a blood vessel wall and for improved delivery of clot busting drugs with applications in stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). For this work, we place a transducer and a microbubble source (using a microfluidics approach) on a catheter. Each of the above projects is supported by an existing NIH R01 4-5 year grant. We are also pursuing projects in photoacoustics, ultrasound image guided radiation oncology (breast cancer application primarily) and in the use of ultrasound for prevention of ischemia-reperfusion injury.
