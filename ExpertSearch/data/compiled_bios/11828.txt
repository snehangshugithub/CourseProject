He has focused his attention on transforming mathematics education for engineers, and the development and mentorship of a diverse faculty body. Dr. Geddes applies the tools and techniques of applied mathematics to a variety of problems in science and engineering. Over the years, he has worked with numerous collaborators on projects in fields like nonlinear optics and mathematical biology. His expertise is in mathematical and computational modeling, nonlinear dynamics and chaos. More recently, he is working with a group of faculty and students to develop and deploy navigation technology for blind sailors. He has received funding from the NSF and the NIH to support his work. Dr. Geddes also brings his passion for applied mathematics to the classroom. He has developed and taught courses at all levels of the undergraduate curriculum, but he has focused on courses for first- and second-year students. Many of the courses that he has been involved with are inter-disciplinary, and co-taught with a range of faculty from across the disciplines. Dr. Geddes believes that undergraduate students have enormous potential for growth, and his courses usually emphasize self-directed learning and intrinsic motivation. Dr. Geddes has a B.Sc. in Computational Physics from Heriot-Watt University in Scotland, and a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Arizona. Prior to joining Olin College of Engineering, Dr. Geddes served on the faculty at the University of New Hampshire and Ramapo College of New Jersey. Dr. Geddes is a passionate sailor, who enjoys spending time at sea with his family. He holds his US Coast Guard OUPV License, and is a certified American Sailing Association instructor.
