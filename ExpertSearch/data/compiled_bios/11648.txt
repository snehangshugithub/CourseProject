He is cross appointed to the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Environment. In the Faculty of Engineering, he is cross appointed to the Department of Management Sciences and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Professor Nathwani joined the University of Waterloo in 2007. Professor Nathwani is currently leading a Global Change Initiative - Affordable Energy for Humanity to address the challenge of enabling universal access. The focus of this global collaborative effort involves leading universities around the world. The twin goals are to drive the scientific and technological innovations required for energy transitions to a cleaner low carbon energy system and to deliver affordable energy to the vast proportion of humanity that has minimal access to electricity and modern fuels for basic needs. Professor Nathwanis research interests include energy policy developments, entrepreneurial business innovations for sustainable energy solutions, life-cycle risk management of energy systems, decision-frameworks for managing life safety risks and assessment of strategies and policy instruments for achieving environmental objectives. He has contributed to national and global strategic planning initiatives for sustainability of energy options, including smart energy networks and grids. He serves on several boards at the provincial and national levels including the Ontario Smart Grid Forum, the Ontario Centre of Excellence (OCE) and the Council for Clean and Reliable Electricity (CCRE). He is the Scientific Advisor to the Waterloo Global Science Initiative (WGSI), a partnership of the Perimeter Institute and the University of Waterloo. Professor Nathwani has appeared frequently in the media and has over 100 publications related to energy and risk management, including 7 books.Research InterestsEngineering Design and OperationOptimization of Safety and EconomicsPlanning for Energy InfrastructureRisk AssessmentEngineering Code of PracticeScience and Energy PolicyData Analytics ResearchEducation1980, P.
