More specifically, Dr. Zides work focuses on the epitaxial growth of semiconductors and metal/semiconductor nanocomposites by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). These nanocomposites consist of conventional III V semiconductors with epitaxially-embedded nanoparticles. The resulting material can have electronic, optical, and thermal properties which are extremely different from the constituent materials. New semiconductors being explored include dilute bismuthides, in which the incorporation of small amounts of bismuth cause anamolously narrow bandgaps, making these materials useful for optoelectronics and thermoelectrics. Dr. Zides focus is on using these unique abilities to tailor the properties of materials to improve the performance of a wide variety of devices and also enable the development of devices which would otherwise be infeasible to realize. Specific problems of interest include energy conversion (specifically, thermoelectric and photovoltaic), integrated optoelectronics, and ultrafast optical devices, but his interests are wide and his research is extremely interdisciplinary.
