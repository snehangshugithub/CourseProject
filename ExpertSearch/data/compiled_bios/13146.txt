Fulton is an assistant professor and a Croll Sesquicentennial Fellowwhose research interests include hydrologicandthermal processes within fault zones and how these processes either controlfault slip behavior or provide insightful signatureswithin fault rocks. After post-docs in Oregon and Texas and a stint as a research scientist in California, Fulton took a faculty position at Texas A&M in 2016, where he taught for three years.Research InterestsFulton uses observation, quantitative analysis, and numerical modeling to study heat and fluid in fault zones. His work combines hydrogeology, thermal geophysics, and geomechanics, and hasapplications to earthquake physics,tectonic processes, and the transport ofsubsurface heat and fluids.Geophysics and SeismologyTectonics and Structural GeologyEnergy, Mineral and Water ResourcesSelected PublicationsFulton, P.M., E.E.
