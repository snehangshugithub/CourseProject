He is an internationally recognized research professor in the field of risk management and life cycle methods. Dr. Pandey has extensive research experience in the areas of mechanics and reliability of engineering structures. His research interests include the reliability of engineering systems, structural dynamics and passive control, estimation of the life-time distribution of an asset using inspection and surveillance data, optimum asset replacement/retirement scheduling, and the modelling of deterioration as a random process to predict failure probability over time. Other interests of Dr. Pandeys include the derivation of information from a small sample of data, maintenance scheduling given the life-time distribution of an asset, and cost-benefit analysis of risk management programs. The specific goals of his research program are to advance the probabilistic analysis techniques for estimating reliability and remaining life of critical systems, structures and components. Dr. Pandey is also developing models and tools for optimizing inspection, maintenance and life-cycle management strategies, and a general, plant-level risk management model to integrate both engineering and business risks. As a result of his work, Dr. Pandey has received several awards and honours. He was the recipient of the Premiers Research Excellence Award for the Province of Ontario in 2003, as well as the UWaterloo Faculty of Engineering Distinguished Performance Award in 1999 and 2002. Additionally in 1998, Dr. Pandey was presented with the Governor General of Canadas Gold Medal.Research InterestsRisk analysisReliability engineeringStochastic processesLife-cycle managementMaintenance optimizationUltrasonic inspectionCondition assessmentProbabilistic system identificationStructuresMechanics & ConstructionEducation1992, Doctorate, Civil Engineering, University of Waterloo1988, Master of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, University of Waterloo1986, Bachelor's, Civil Engineering, Bhopal UniversityCourses*CIVE 601 - Engineering Risk & ReliabilityTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsPandey, Mahesh, Technical Basis of a Probabilistic Method for PT-CT Contact Assessment, , 2016Balomenos, Georgios P and Pandey, Mahesh D, Finite element reliability and sensitivity analysis of structures using the multiplicative dimensional reduction method, Structure and Infrastructure Engineering, 2016, 1 - 13Jyrkama, Mikko I and Bickel, Grant A and Pandey, Mahesh D, Statistical analysis and modelling of in-reactor diametral creep of Zr-2.5 Nb pressure tubes, Nuclear Engineering and Design, 300, 2016, 241 - 248Wang, Zhaoliang and Xie, Wei-Chau and Pandey, MD, Computationally Efficient Vector-Valued Seismic Risk Analysis of Engineering Structures, Journal of Structural Engineering, 2016Jyrkama, Mikko I and Pandey, Mahesh D, On the separation of aleatory and epistemic uncertainties in probabilistic assessments, Nuclear Engineering and Design, 303, 2016, 68 - 74Graduate StudiesCurrently considering applications from graduate students.
