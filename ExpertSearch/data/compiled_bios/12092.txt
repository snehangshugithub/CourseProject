Ontario Tech acknowledges the lands and people of the Mississaugas of Scugog Island First Nation. We are thankful to be welcome on these lands in friendship. The lands we are situated on are covered by the Williams Treaties and are the traditional territory of the Mississaugas, a branch of the greater Anishinaabeg Nation, including Algonquin, Ojibway, Odawa and Pottawatomi. These lands remain home to many Indigenous nations and peoples. We acknowledge this land out of respect for the Indigenous nations who have cared for Turtle Island, also called North America, from before the arrival of settler peoples until this day. Most importantly, we acknowledge that the history of these lands has been tainted by poor treatment and a lack of friendship with the First Nations who call them home. This history is something we are all affected by because we are all treaty people in Canada. We all have a shared history to reflect on, and each of us is affected by this history in different ways. Our past defines our present, but if we move forward as friends and allies, then it does not have to define our future.

About the Faculty of Science Our innovative Science programs adhere to our interdisciplinary philosophy and emphasize the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the ever changing 21st-century workplace. We view science as a springboard to a wide range of knowledge, careers (e.g. in industry, government, academia, and the non-profit sector) and to the exploration and understanding of how our universe works. With a strong scientific foundation in analytical and problem-solving skills, you will have the tools you need to adapt to future developments in the scientific path of your choice. Our undergraduate and graduate programs provide excellent opportunities for students to gain valuable knowledge, training and experience in core subject matter and across disciplines. Whether in class, lab or through experiential learning such as co-op or field work, the Faculty of Science emphasizes the development of leadership and communication skills in all of our students. We are dedicated to creating and sharing scientific knowledge and infusing the thrill of discovery while inspiring vision, determination, independence, critical thinking and integrity in our students.
