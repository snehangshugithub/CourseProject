Rochester Institute of Technology, 1990Ph.D. University of Virginia, 1995 "The Price Laboratory develops image-guided drug and gene delivery approaches for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases." Dr. Price's research program centers on the development and implementation of image-guided drug and gene delivery systems for treating cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.Several lines of investigation in the lab are derived fromseminal studies demonstrating that microbubble activation with ultrasound can enable the delivery of therapeutic drug- and gene-bearing nanoparticles across endothelial barriers under MR image-guidance. Other projects in the lab investigate how minimally-invasive focused ultrasound energy deposition into solid tumors may be optimally combined with immunotherapy to treat metastatic disease. Research in this space supports3 ongoing UVA clinical trials for metastatic breast cancer and other solid malignancies. In his role as Research Director of the UVA Focused Ultrasound Center, he leads an institution-wide effort to identify, investigate, and translate new focused ultrasound applications.

Price, PhD, of UVAs School of Medicine and School of Engineering, is using focused soundwaves to overcome the natural blood-brain barrier, which protects the brain from harmful pathogens Read More Tackling Cancer Through Team Science Tackling Cancer Through Team Science Clinical Trial is First of Its Kind in the World, Combining Focused Ultrasound and Immunotherapy to Treat Breast Cancer in Humans For patients suffering from metastatic breast cancer, where the disease has spread throughout the body, the survival rate is only 22%. These women and men face ongoing treatment for the rest of their lives, often with harsh side effects. Although treatable, there is no cure for metastatic disease. The University of Virginia Health System is working to change that, and has launched a clinical trial that uses groundbreaking focused ultrasound technology to target metastatic breast cancer and make tumors responsive to immunotherapywithout surgery. The study is the first in the world to combine focused ultrasound and immunotherapy to treat breast cancer in humans. If successful, this clinical trial will provide new hope for patients diagnosed with this late stage of breast cancer.

Lockhart Memorial Prize for work that advances the use of focused ultrasound to treat cancer. Read More Riding a Wave of Sound One way to get drugs through the blood-brain barrier: smuggle them across using sound waves The blood-brain barrier, a name given to the tightly packed vascular cells in the brains capillaries, keeps the central nervous system remarkably free of most pathogens. But that defense is a major challenge for delivering drugs that treat brain disorders. One reason glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer, is so lethal is that treatments cant get across the barrier to reach tumors Read More Selected Publications Ultrasound-Targeted Nucleic Acid Delivery to Solid Tumors.
