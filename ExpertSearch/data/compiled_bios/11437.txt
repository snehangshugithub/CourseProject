Prior to this appointment, she was appointed as the Jim & Lynn Williams Assistant Professor at Oklahoma State University. Education Ph.D. Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Florida, 2014 B.S. Information and Computing Sciences, Fudan University, 2010 Research Statement Dr. Zhao works on data-driven optimization methodologies to support strategic and operational planning in power systems management. She developed innovative data-driven approaches to enable effective decision-making under uncertainty for power system scheduling problems such as optimal power flow and unit commitment. Her analytical models advance scalable solution methods to improve cost-effectiveness, streamline daily power system operations, and mitigate system disruptions and risk. Dr. Zhao has received multiple grants from the federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation, Department of Transportation and Argonne National Laboratory. She is the recipient of awards including the runner up of the Pritsker Doctoral Dissertation Award, and Energy Systems Division Outstanding Young Investigator Award in IISE. Select publications A.
