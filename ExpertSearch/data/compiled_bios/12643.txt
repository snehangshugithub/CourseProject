After years of industrial experience at IBM, Bell Labs, GE, and GAIN, he spent most of his academic career at Lehigh University. He cofounded GAIN and QED; the latter became the public company IQE. He used to be a Program Officer at the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research for GHz-THz Electronics. He had been a visiting professor at Cornell University in the US, Marche Polytechnic University in Italy, Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China. He is an IEEE Life Fellow and a Distinguished Microwave Lecturer. He is also a Track Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques. He has published approximately 400 refereed technical papers and been granted eight U.S. patents. He has researched electronic, optical, and micro-electromechanical devices and circuits. His current research interest includes scanning microwave microscopy, two-dimensional atomic-layered materials and devices, and electromagnetic sensors for individual biological cells.Research InterestsElectronic, optical, and micro-electromechanical devices and circuits.Advanced MaterialsAdvanced Materials ProcessingMaterials Synthesis and ProcessingSemiconductor Physics and DevicesNanotechnologyBiomedical Imaging and InstrumentationSensors and ActuatorsSelected PublicationsP.
