Research Interests Conductive polymer composites Renewable-source based and biodegradable polymer blends and composites Multiphase polymers and foams Polyolefin-Based Nanocomposites Polymer Processing and Additive Manufacturing Thermoplastic Olefin Blends and Thermoplastic Vulcanizates. Polymers are fascinating materials, which can deliver various functionalities. They are amenable to structure manipulation, which provides infinite opportunities to combine properties. This makes them among the most versatile materials available. Manipulation of the structure of polymer compounds through processing can provide a wide range of commodity, specialty and high-value added applications in many sectors, including the manufacturing, structural, biomedical, and various high-tech industries. Prof. Kontopoulous group conducts research on advanced polymer technologies, including polyolefin and bioplastic compounds, polymer nanocomposites, thermoplastic foams, and electrically conductive composites. Our aim is to design multiphase polymeric materials with tailored structures, such as compatibilized compounds and nanocomposites with improved processability, multiple functionalities and fine-tuned properties. Rheology is used extensively as a tool to characterize the structure of the materials that we produce. Rigorous structure-property relations are established through microscopy and detailed mechanical testing analysis. For more details click here.

Current research activities include: Sustainable solutions in the plastics industry In recent years the production and use of bioplastics has seen explosive growth driven by environmental concerns, waste disposal challenges and perceived future problems with the supply of petroleum products. Our research has the objective to develop economically viable, solvent-free, environmentally friendly processes to obtain fully bio-based products, with excellent engineering properties that can gain wide-spread consumer acceptance, while providing a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution. Applications are envisioned in automotive, packaging and foam processing. Students who are interested in conducting research in the area of sustainable polymers can apply to work toward a Collaborative Masters in Applied Sustainability.http://my.engineering.queensu.ca/programs/mas/http://www.queensu.ca/sgs/applied-sustainability-collaborative Biobased polylactic acid foams Polymer nanocomposites Conductive polymer/matrix composites Polymer nanocomposites, which combine superior engineering properties with desirable traits such as light weight, ease of manufacturing and recyclability are of major scientific and technological importance. Specifically conductive polymer/matrix composites are expected to make a big technological and commercial impact in applications where electrical conductivity, superior heat conduction, and mechanical robustness are desired material attributes. Applications of conductive composites can be envisioned in fire retardant additives, high-strength composites, electromagnetic interference shielding, energy storage devices, wearable sensors, electro-mechanical actuators, coatings suitable for electrostatic painting etc. Polyethylene/graphene Polyethylene/carbon nanotubes Polypropylene/nanosilica Thermoplastic material development for Additive Manufacturing/3D printing Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, has seen explosive growth in recent years and has been touted as a replacement for traditional manufacturing, offering great flexibility in the way products are developed and produced. Polymers in various forms, including liquid solutions and thermoplastic melts, can be used to manufacture a wide variety of products. At the forefront of this research is the quest for biobased and biodegradable polymeric materials, to ensure the sustainable character of additive technologies. The purpose of our research is to develop new biodegradable thermoplastic biopolyester formulations for use in 3D-Bioplotting, which is a specialized additive manufacturing equipment for biomedical applications, offering the advantages of solvent-free, continuous manufacturing to produce scaffolds, fibrous mats for tissue engineering, and potentially other types of fibrous structures.
