Manufacturing Systems Eng., University of Wisconsin-Madison, Waterloo, WI B.S. Electical Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OHResearch InterestsAs a design engineer in the automotive parts industry, I found that an engineer's job depends on the ability to efficiently collect and analyze data. Since many engineers have limited access to statistical methods, my research is to develop simple-to-use, yet statistically powerful tools for the design and analysis of both physical and simulation-based experiments.I have recently been involved with research on adapting design of experiment techniques for use in simulation experiments.These experiments are run on simulation models of manufacturing or other large scale systems and help engineers and managers to make tactical and strategic decisions based on realistic computer models.Since I view statistical methods as tools to be used for a purpose, I am concerned with the entire process of design, development, and continuous improvement in industry.These broader interests have led to my directorships in the Segal Design Institute and to the co-founding and teaching of the popular Northwestern class, Designing Your Life. In Segal, I direct education programs which focus on the full design process with special attention to meeting human needs.Selected PublicationsErickson, Collin B.; Ankenman, Bruce E.; Plumlee, Matthew; Sanchez, Susan M., Gradient based criteria for sequential design, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.:467-478.Lane, Jacqueline Ng; Ankenman, Bruce E; Iravani, Seyed MR, Insight into gender differences in higher education, Service Science 10(4):442-456.Erickson, Collin B.; Ankenman, Bruce E.; Sanchez, Susan M., Data from fitting Gaussian process models to various data sets using eight Gaussian process software packages, Data in Brief 18:684-687.Duan, Weitao; Ankenman, Bruce E.; Sanchez, Susan M.; Sanchez, Paul J., Sliced Full Factorial-Based Latin Hypercube Designs as a Framework for a Batch Sequential Design Algorithm, Technometrics 59(1):11-22.Erickson, Collin B.; Ankenman, Bruce E.; Sanchez, Susan M., Comparison of Gaussian process modeling software, European Journal of Operational Research 266(1):179-192.Erickson, Collin; Ankenman, Bruce E.; Sanchez, Susan M., Comparison of Gaussian process modeling software, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.:3692-3693.Del Torto, Lisa M.; Ankenman, Bruce; Benjamin, Stacy; Harty, Trevor; Hirsch, Penny L., Exploring interdisciplinary design in relation to workplace success and campus community, ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings 2016-June.
