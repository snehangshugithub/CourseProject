His research interests are primarily in (thermo)mechanics and transport phenomena in random and fractal media, advanced continuum theories, and stochastic wave propagation. His work established quantitative estimates of the size of representative volume element (RVE) of continuum models for many linear and nonlinear, elastic and inelastic materials. On this basis, Martin has played a central role in introducing a statistical volume element (SVE) to formulate micromechanics-based, tensor random field models for stochastic PDEs and finite elements. In recent years, Martin has (i) led mechanics of fractal materials, and (ii) pioneered continuum physics with violations of the second law of thermodynamics. He wrote 225+ journal papers, including 18 in Proceedings/Philosophical Transactions of Royal Society, London A; 8 in Physical Review B and E; 2 in Physical Review Letters. Over 30 books cite his work, including several leading ones in applied mathematics and mechanics, such as G.W. Miltons Theory of Composites, S. Torquatos Random Heterogeneous Materials, B. Straughans Explosive Instabilities in Mechanics and Heat Waves, V.E. Tarasovs Fractional Dynamics, V.F. Nesterenkos Dynamics of Heterogeneous Materials, M. Grigorius Stochastic Calculus, or D. Krajcinovics Damage Mechanics. Martin also wrote four books: 1. Microstructural Randomness and Scaling in Mechanics of Materials, CRC Modern Mechanics and Mathematics Series (2007); 2. Thermoelasticity with Finite Wave Speeds, Oxford Mathematical Monographs, Oxford University Press (2009); 3. A. Malyarenko and M. Ostoja-Starzewski, Tensor-Valued Random Fields for Continuum Physics, Cambridge Monographs on Mathematical Physics, Cambridge University Press, 2019; 4. A. Malyarenko, M. Ostoja-Starzewski and A. Amiri-Hezaveh, Random Fields of Piezoelectricity and Piezomagnetism, SpringerBriefs, 2020. Martin is very active in the editorial sphere having (co-)edited 15 books/journal special issues and co-organized various meetings, including a NATO Adv. Res. Workshop (1993); a Course at CISM (2000); 8th Pan American Cong. Appl. Mech. (PACAM-VIII, 2004); 20th Canadian Cong. Appl. Mech. (CANCAM 2005); and 8th Intl. Congress on Thermal Stresses (2009 at UIUC). He is Editor of Acta Mechanica, Chair Managing Editor of Mathematics and Mechanics of Complex Systems (MEMOCS), Editor-in-Chief of Journal of Thermal Stresses (2017-); Assoc. Editor of Mechanics Research Communications (2015-) and ASME Journal of Applied Mechanics (2006-2012); co-Editor of CRC Modern Mechanics and Mathematics Series (2012-). He is on the editorial boards of 10 other journals. He is Fellow of ASME, AAM (American Academy of Mechanics), WIF (World Innovation Foundation), SES, and Associate Fellow of AIAA. He was on the Executive Committee of The International Society for the Interaction of Mechanics and Mathematics (ISIMM), 2013-2016. Worcester Reed Warner Medal of ASME (2018).
