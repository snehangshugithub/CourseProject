She joined the ECE Department at Portland State in 1998, serving as chair from 2004 to 2010. She has published over 150 peer-reviewed journal and conference papers. Her research focuses on heterogeneous integration: CAD for submicron 3DICs and Monolithics, ML and Quantum Inspired Algorithms for physical design of VLSI ICs, CNFETs and nanowire FETs, and emerging technologies. She made significant contributions to understanding the behavior of BJTs in cryogenic temperatures, logic synthesis of EXOR-based circuits, physical design of 3D ICs, and statistical design of Carbon-nanotubes FETs. She received the IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation 2008 Donald O. Pederson Best Paper Award and the Best Paper Award from the Alabama Section of IEEE for the best IEEE Transactions paper in 1990, among other distinctions. She serves as Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on NANO (2021-), IOP Nano Express Editorial Board Member, and was Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on CAS II, JETCAS, and multiple times Guest Editor for IEEE TNANO, VLSI International Journal, and Analog Integration Circuits and Signal Processing. Since 2019 she serves as IEEE Nanotechnology Council (NTC) Finance VP, and currently on IEEE Technical Activity Board Awards and Recognition Committee, Chair of Nanoelectronics TC, and Oregon IEEE CMPT/CAS Chapter VP. Over the years she held many other volunteer positions including: IEEE NTC VP for Technical Activities, NTC Advisory Committee, NTC Distinguish Lecturer Program (DLP) Chair, IEEE Circuits and Systems Society (CASS) Board of Governors member for two terms, CASS DLP Chair, and CASS Nano and Giga-scale Systems TC Chair, and many other CASS and NTC Committees. She is a founding member of Women in CAS and was its Chair, 2010-11. Awards and Recognition: 2017 IEEE Life Senior Member 2008 Donald O.
