Prior to arriving at Cornell in 2005, Pritchard was a Harry Hess Postdoctoral Scholar at Princeton University, a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology, and an undergraduate student at the University of Chicago.Research InterestsGeophysics, glaciology, geodesy, tectonics, and volcanology; Optical and radar satellite remote sensing, subsurface energy systems.Remote SensingEarth System ScienceSpace Science and EngineeringGeophysics and SeismologyGeochemistry, Petrology and VolcanologyPaleontology, Sedimentary Basins & Surface ProcessesEnergy, Mineral and Water ResourcesSpace and Planetary SciencesGeophysical Fluid DynamicsNatural HazardsTectonics and Structural GeologyTeaching InterestsGlobal geophysics, active tectonics, planetary surfaces and geophysics, remote sensing, glaciers, lunar geology, and subsurface energy systems.Selected PublicationsDurkin W.
