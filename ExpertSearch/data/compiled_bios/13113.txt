Probabilistic and stochastic models are developed to improve our understanding of the hydrologic and hydraulic processes involved in the operation of the drainage network, flood control, stormwater management, and water distribution systems. Impacts of climate change and remediation measures are investigated. Alternative planning and design approaches and modelling methodologies are proposed, tested and promoted. A comprehensive set of analytical probabilistic models have being developed for the planning and design of urban stormwater management systems and tested for many North American locations.
