His work focuses on advanced modeling and computational modeling of complex flows for combustion and shock physics systems.Professor Stewart recently received a National Academies Fellowship, Senior Research Award, and is pursuing research at the Air Force Research Laboratory/Munitions Directorate at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. He recently developed new descriptions of the ignition transients and criticality for well-posed continuum models of explosives that can be used to describe macroscopic phenomena. These models assume that the explosive is a continuum with well-defined average properties. Yet, at the microscopic level, energy adsorption and redistribution is uneven and localized. Understanding this process of energy partitioning requires models that account for this complex microstructural environment as well as the many kinds of mechanisms that absorb and release energy at that level.As a National Academies Fellow, Professor Stewart studies complex issues involving the ignition of energetic materials-particularly mechanisms and collective behaviors of reactive sites at the microscale. He also helps design optical probe experiments in condensed explosives that allow him to scientifically measure shock ignition transients to fit to theoretical models. The goal is to develop a basis for new sub-models for explosive particle interactions. Research Areas Fluid Mechanics Selected Articles in Journals Stewart, D. S., J. A. Saenz, G. Rodriguez, A. R.
