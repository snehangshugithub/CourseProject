Harvard Medical School Cytoskeleton and Cell Adhesion Our lab is interested in understanding how cells organize an actin cytoskeleton. Current projects focus on how actin filaments are assembled at cell-cell adhesive junctions, how actin filaments disassemble, and how signals trigger actin assembly. We use a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and cell biological techniques to address these questions which are fundamental for understanding cell shape, cell motility, and morphogenesis. Some of our research provides insight into the molecular basis of inherited kidney disease. Awards LAS Dean's Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching. Representative Publications Vivian W.
