Her technical responsibilities are centered in silicon microstrip trackers and b-quark identification. She is a member of the D-Zero collaboration at Fermilab and the CMS collaboration at CERN. She was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2010. Selected Publications Observation of Single Top Quark Production, Physical Review Letters 103, 092001 (2009); PRL Editors Suggestion.
