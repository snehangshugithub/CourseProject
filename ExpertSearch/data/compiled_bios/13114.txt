He is interested in the application of innovative tools, including AI, machine learning, computer vision and agent-based modeling, in analyzing road users behaviour. This comprehensive analysis supports the investigation of many applications, such as safety studies, interactions between non-motorized road users and Connected/Autonomous vehicles, among other applications. He is also interested in the application of reliability theory in transportation engineering, the statistical analysis of collision data, and the surrogate measures of safety. Education B.Sc., M.Sc.
