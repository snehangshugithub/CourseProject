School News Woodward part of research team that captures unique images of Ios volcanoes Jupiters moon, Io, is one of the most volcanically active body in the solar system and yet, scientists have not been able to capture detailed images of volcanism and lava flows regularly. School of The Big Picture: Rudnick helps lead effort that reveals the stormy weather in galaxy clusters Professor Emeritus Lawrence Rudnick of the School of Physics and Astronomy led the Technical Working Group of the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS). Furmanski part of collaboration that casts doubt on the so-called sterile neutrino Assistant Professor Andrew Furmanski, a faculty member in the School, is a member of a collaboration known as MicroBooNE, 170-ton liquid-argon detector at Fermilab, whose results have possibly Wang finds unique properties by giving three layers of graphene a twist Ke Wang, an Assistant Professor in the School of Physics and Astronomy, led a recent experimental effort to study the electrical properties of a novel architecture of graphene--a single atomic layer Roberta Humphreys on Luminous Blue Variables Professor Roberta Humphreys of the School of Physics and Astronomy recently gave a colloquium that served as a primer on some of the most interesting stars I know: luminous blue variables (LBVs).
