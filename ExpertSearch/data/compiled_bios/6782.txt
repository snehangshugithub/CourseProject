Martin Faculty Adjunct Professor of Applied Physics Emeritus Professor of Physics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Sites Stanford ProfilePersonal WebsiteDescription of Interests: Theory of condensed matter, especially the electronic structure of solids. Examples of recent work include density functional calculations for stability and superconductivity in doped fullerenes, new structures of nitrogen at high pressure, Monte Carlo simulations of many-body electron problems in one-dimensional electron wires, the theory of polarization and localization in insulators, and topological quantum order in Mott insulators.
