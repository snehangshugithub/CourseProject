He joined the Department of Mechanical Engineering in 2011. His research interests focus on both fundamental and applied CFD in multi-disciplines. Fundamental CFD research includes estimation of errors and uncertainties using quantitative solution verification and validation (V&V) methods and entropy generation for bypass transitional boundary layers. For V&V, he developed the "factor of safety method" for solution verification that was evaluated as one of the two most accurate uncertainty estimates for monotonically converged numerical solutions. He was invited to give 14 lectures including the keynote lecture on verification and validation in the 13th National Congress on Hydrodynamics & 26th Conference on Hydrodynamics in China. Applied CFD research covers a broad range of disciplines where CFD can be used to improve understanding of flow physics and optimize designs: onshore and offshore wind turbine designs, vehicle aerodynamics, pulmonary ventilation including fluid-structure interaction, ship hydrodynamics, and desalination, etc. His teaching interests focus on integration of simulation and mobile technology into engineering courses and laboratories, development of effective formative and summative evaluation methods, and development of innovative teaching modules toward achieving ABET learning outcomes. He has been the author or co-author of 38 refereed journal papers, 36 peer-reviewed conference papers, and 2 book chapters. His Google Scholar h-index and i10-index are 21 and 29, respectively. As a PI or Co-PI, he has secured more than 2.8 million dollars funding since he joined the University of Idaho in 2011 including U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Transportation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of U.S. Department of Commerce (NOAA), Percussionaire Corp., Vorsana Inc., Murdock foundation, Avista Corp., Biogen, Idaho Global Entrepreneurial Mission (IGEM), and The University of Idaho. He has graduated one Ph.D. student and five M.S./M.E. students and am currently advising one Ph.D. and one M.S. students. He serves as an Associate Editor of the ASME Journal of Verification, Validation and Uncertainty Quantification and an executive member of the editorial board of Journal of Hydrodynamics (Springer). He served as an editorial board member of Heliyon (Elsevier) from 2016 to 2018. He also served as a member of the Technical Program Committee of the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE) Annual Conferences in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 including a Session Chair in ISOPE 2015. He is a licensed U.S. Professional Engineer (P.E.).
