Biography Dr. Yehuda Braiman is Research Professor at The College of Photonics and Optics and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Central Florida started January 2020. He is also an Adjunct Professor at the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace, and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Tennessee. Prior to his appointment at UCF, Dr. Braiman held an appointment of a Distinguished R&D Scientist at Computational Sciences and Engineering Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Joint Faculty Professor at Department of Mechanical, Aerospace, and Biomedical Engineering, University of Tennessee. Research Interests Dr. Braimans research interests cover multiple disciplines including lasers and optics, dynamics of Josephson junctions and Josephson junction arrays, nonlinear dynamics and chaos control, friction and fracture at the atomistic scale, and detection of weak signals in noisy environment. Specific applications include beam combining and phase-locking of high-power, broad-area semiconductor diode arrays, studying the dynamics and formation of ultrafast pulses in semiconductor diodes, design of cryogenic memory based on small arrays of Josephson junctions, and studying effects of very weak perturbations on noisy extended nonlinear systems. He co-authored 57 journal papers, 17 refereed conference papers, and 8 book chapters, edited one book, and co-authored 4 patents. Some of Dr. Braimans research accomplishments include (1) discovery of chaos in Josephson junctions (with E. Ben Jacob and Y. Imry); (2) devised a method to control chaos (with I. Goldhirsch, Physical Review Letters article cited more close to 600 times according to Google Scholar); and (3) proposed a method to eliminate spatiotemporal chaos by introducing spatial disorder (article highlighted on the cover page of Nature and in Nature News & Views, (Taming Spatiotempoal Chaos with Disorder, with W. L. Ditto and J. F. Lindner, article cited more than 250 times according to Google Scholar). Most recently, Dr. Braiman in collaboration with N. Nair, J. Rezac, R. Glowinski, and N. Imam proposed design for cryogenic memory cell. In the proposed design all the basic memory operations are implemented on the same circuit and it has a potential to substantially reduce memory access time dissipation energy and reduce memory cell size. This design has been published in Superconductor Science and Technology and paper was selected for a Superconductor Science and Technology 2016 Highlight Collection.
