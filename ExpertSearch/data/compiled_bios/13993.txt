Investigations range from numerical studies and analysis of animal data, to simulation studies of theoretical models, to designing, constructing, and experimenting with legged robots for walking and running, and more recently, using machine learning techniques merged with more traditional control to enable highly dynamic gaits. Biography Jonathan W. Hurst is aProfessor of Robotics, co-founder of the Oregon State University Robotics Institute, and Chief Technology Officer and co-founder of Agility Robotics. He holds a B.S. in mechanical engineering and an M.S. and Ph.D. in robotics, all from Carnegie Mellon University. His university research focuses on understanding the fundamental science and engineering best practices for legged locomotion. Investigations range from numerical studies and analysis of animal data, to simulation studies of theoretical models, to designing, constructing, and experimenting with legged robots for walking and running, and more recently, using machine learning techniques merged with more traditional control to enable highly dynamic gaits. Agility Robotics is extending this research to commercial applications for robotic legged mobility, working towards a day when robots can go where people go, generate greater productivity across the economy, and improve quality of life for all.
