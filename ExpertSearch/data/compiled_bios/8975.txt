Prior to coming to Northeastern, he was an engineer at Raytheon Company, working in coherent CO2 laser radar for remote sensing of the atmosphere and for other applications. At Northeastern, he continued his interest in remote sensing but moved toward applications in medicine and biology. He invented optical quadrature microscopy for imaging phase objects, which has been used in research on embryo development. He also led the development of the Keck 3-D fusion microscope which combines optical quadrature with confocal and multi-photon microscopy for many applications in medicine and biology. He also pioneered novel techniques for medical imaging with ultrasound-modulated light. He has developed novel imaging approaches for measurements of collagen fibrils and monomers.He teaches graduate courses in optics, and a variety of undergraduate courses including engineering design, electronics, and subsurface sensing & imaging.

Jan 25, 2016I.Q. Project Highlight: Medical ImagingDespite the rapid progress in biomedical optics in the past decade, a need for ever-greater speed, resolution, and depth of imaging persists. For example, tissue sectioning with confocal reflectance microscopy to evaluate cellular and sub-cellular features in vivo is a popular method but has limitations. This technique can produce 2D images with 500 x 500 [] May 26, 2015DiMarzio Awarded $300K NSF GrantECE Associate Professor Charles DiMarzio was awarded a $300K NSF grant for "Coded-illumination Fourier Ptychography for High-content Multimodal Imaging".Aug 27, 2014Infrared Imaging SystemECE Associate Professor Charles DiMarzio was awarded a patent for his Tunable laser-based infrared imaging system and method of use thereof .May 09, 2014DiMarzio Professor of the YearECE Associate Professor Charles DiMarzio was selected Professor of the Year by Eta Kappa Nu for his outstanding contributions to the ECE department.Mar 20, 2014Congratulations to recipients of the FY15 TIER 1 Interdisciplinary Research Seed Grants19 COE faculty were recipients of FY15 TIER 1 Interdisciplinary Research Seed Grants for 11 different projects representing over $500K dollars of investment in research.
