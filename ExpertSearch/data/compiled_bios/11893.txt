In the area of aerodynamics/propulsion/turbomachine, research interests include novel airfoil concepts for propulsion and circulation control by embedding crossflow fans into the airfoil/wing,body-forcemodelling of bypass fan system in full aircraft CFD simulations under 3D inlet distortion,development of highly-coupled coil and wide-angle vane-diffuser axial fanconcept, aerodynamics and design of cooling fan in compact and high-power computer servers. In the area of lndoor Air Quality (IAQ) and Energy Systems, research interests include studies to improve the personal micro-environment in built-environments (e.g. building offices, aircraft cabins) using local air delivery and removal systems, control of natural ventilation in tall buildings with aerodynamic shape via manipulating building envelope pressure loading with emphasis on the use of novel concepts to synergistically harvest wind energy and improve IAQ, and flow/thermal management from server to data-center room levels.
