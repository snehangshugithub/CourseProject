His research focusses on multiaxial behavior of advanced ceramics, metals, composites, gels and biological materials. He has developed novel experimental methods which have been patented and widely used. He has co-authored 205 peer reviewed journal articles (8400 citations in Google Scholar, h-index=48), 85 conference proceedings, 2-books, and 6 patents. He has given numerous keynote and invited lectures at major international conferences. He has graduated 35-PhD students and is currently advising 6-PhD students and one post-doctoral fellow. Many of his students have received awards at International Student Paper Competitions in professional societies and were awarded fellowships from NSF, DOD, and DOE. His former students are employed at major Universities in US and abroad, and national laboratories including SNL, ORNL, PNNL and ARL. He is a Fellow of three societies: The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), Society of Experimental Mechanics (SEM), and the American Ceramic Society (ACerS). He is the Editor-in-Chief of Mechanics of Materials (an International Journal) and Associate Editor of Journal of the American Ceramic Society. He has received numerous awards for teaching, research and professional service including the SEM Lazan Award (2021) for innovative contributions to experimental mechanics, UF Doctoral Dissertation Advisor/Mentoring Award (2021), SEM Frocht Award (2018) in recognition of outstanding achievements as an educator, Best Paper-Journal of Engineering Materials and Technology (2016), Significant Contribution Award for development of rapid processing scheme of ceramic nuclear fuels from the American Nuclear Society. Technology Innovator Award from University of Florida, ASME Student Section Advisor Award, SAE Ralph R. Teetor Educational Award, and ASEE Outstanding New Mechanics Educator award. He has also served as the National Academies of Engineering Panel Member.
