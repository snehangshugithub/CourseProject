Parmenter Jon W. Parmenter Associate Professor Mcgraw Hall, Room 324 jwp35@cornell.edu607-255-1876 Website(s) American Indian Studies Program Profile American Studies Program Profile Overview I am a historian of colonial North America, specializing in the history of indigenous peoples in the Northeast, particularly that of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois). I took advantage of my status as a dual citizen of the Canada and the United States to train at what is nowWestern Universityin my hometown of London, Ontario, Canada, and completed my doctorate atUniversity of Michigan. My first book, The Edge of the Woods: Iroquoia, 1534-1701 (2010, reissued inpaperbackin Canada and the USA in 2014) was published with the support of aNational Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship. I argue that the extensive spatial mobility engaged in by Haudenosaunee people after their first contact with Europeans represented a geographical expression of Haudenosaunee social, political, and economic priorities. I drew on archival and published documents in several languages, archaeological data, published Haudenosaunee oral traditions, and GIS technology to reconstruct the Haudenosaunee settlement landscape and the paths of human mobility that built and sustained it. Many of my article-length publications in journals such as Journal of Early American History, Diplomatic History, William and Mary Quarterly, and Recherches Amerindiennes au Quebec are available for consultation at my Academia.eduwebpage. My current research interests include the historical experience of allied Indian nations in the Seven Years' War and American Revolution, the impact of the U.S./Canada border on Native American nations, and contemporary Haudenosaunee nation-building initiatives. At Cornell I am fortunate to reside in close proximity to the people and places I research and write about, and I have also had the privilege to serve as a legal and historical consultant to several Haudenosaunee communities, including most recently theMohawk Council of Akwesasneand theOneida Indian Nation. In December 2014 I was honored to be qualified as a recognized Historical Expert in the History and Ethnography of the Iroquois, inOntario Superior Court. My teaching at Cornell includes courses on America at War to 1898, Everything You Know About Indians is Wrong: An Introduction to Native American History, New World Encounters, the American Revolution (coming Fall 2016) and seminars on Iroquois History, the Seven Years' War, and Treaties and Aboriginal Rights in North American History. In 2011-12 I was a recipient of theStephen and Margery Russell Award for Distinguished Teachingin the College of Arts and Sciences at Cornell. In addition to my work on campus I am frequently on the road speaking to secondary educators, town historians, and the general public in venues such as Fort Ticonderoga's National Endowment for the Humanities"Landmarks in American History and Culture Workshops,"Johnson Hall State Historic Site, theOntario County Historical Society, and theFenimore Art Museum in Cooperstown.
