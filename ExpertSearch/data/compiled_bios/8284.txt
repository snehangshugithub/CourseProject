He has investigated advances in motion control utilizing Iterative Learning Control (ILC) and produced some of the highest precision motion algorithms. These include the formalization of design rules for optimization of feedforward trajectories in ILC. Additionally, he developed the concept of primitives or basis functions for ILC to circumvent limitations in computation that hindered other algorithms. These have found many applications in practice, primarily in the manufacturing area. He developed the mechatronic platform and process control for an electro-hydrodynamic jet printing technique that allowed for precise material placement with orders of magnitude better resolution than the state of the art additive manufacturing approaches. He also utilized his techniques for filament-based additive fabrication of ceramics and metals for biomedical and power electronic applications. In addition to the ILC efforts, a second thrust of Professor Alleynes research is in the dynamic modeling, design, and control of transient thermal systems. On the technological side, he developed a software tool that performs transient simulations of vapor compression cycle systems (VCS)-something that was previously very difficult to model. He and his group developed Thermosys, a Simulink-based toolbox that provided one of the first simulation environments capable of handling dynamic transients in typical HVAC systems. He expanded his modeling capability beyond VCS systems to include other modes of transient thermal energy transport. He was instrumental in developing a tool that has been transitioned to the Air Force Research Laboratory and is part of their, and their contractors, design suite for future platforms. He has also led investigations into the dynamic representation and control of thermal management systems for power electronics, particularly for mobile systems such as cars, planes, ships, etc. The analytical tools used in these efforts include graph theory as well as dynamic optimization both on-line and off line. Early efforts in his career saw him introduce controller design within a dimensionless framework as well as novel gain scheduling approaches. These techniques were applied to automotive vehicles as well as Fluid Power systems.
