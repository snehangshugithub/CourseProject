His field of research is the physics of soft matter, the physics of coulomb fluids and macromolecular interactions, the Lifshitz theory of dispersion interaction, the physics of membranes, polymers and polyelectrolytes and especially the physics of DNA and viruses. Career[edit] Podgornik discovered the line hexatic phase in the phase diagram of the concentrated DNA solutions. The line hexatic mesophase appears to be the preferred packing form of DNA in bacteriophages. He is the author of more than a hundred scientific papers and a coeditor of books: "Electrostatic Effects in Soft Matter" (Proceedings of the NATO Advanced Study Institute, Les Houches, France, 113 October 2000, Series: NATO Science Series II: Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, Vol. 46 ), together with Christian Holm and Patrick Kekicheff and "Electrostatics of Soft and Disordered Matter" (Pan Stanford Publishing, March 31, 2014) with David S. Dean, Jure Dobnikar and Ali Naji. Together with D. Harries, J. DeRouchey, H. H. Strey, and V. A. Parsegian, he coauthored the chapter "Interactions in Macromolecular Complexes Used as Nonviral Vectors for Gene Delivery", in the leading textbook of gene therapy: "Gene Therapy: Therapeutic Mechanisms and Strategies", N. Smyth Templeton, Marcel Dekker, New York (2008), Third Edition. Rudolf Podgornik is the head of the research program Biophysics of polymers, membranes, gels, colloids and cells, financially supported by the Slovene Agency for Research and Development. He is a member of the Theoretical Physics Department at the Jozef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana, and until 2010 he was an adjunct researcher at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD and teaches at the Physics Department, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana and at the Medical Faculty, University of Ljubljana. Since 2011 he is also adjunct professor at the Physics Department, University of Massachusetts, Amherst and since 2013 he is adjunct professor at the Materials Science & Engineering Department at the Case Western Research University, Cleveland. He is a coeditor-in-chief of the Journal of Biological Physics, edited by Springer.
