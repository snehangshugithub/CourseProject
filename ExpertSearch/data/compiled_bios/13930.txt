Sara_Prescott@hms.harvard.edu Email Education PhD, 2016, Stanford University School of Medicine BA, 2008, Molecular Biology, Princeton University Research Summary Our bodies are tuned to detect and respond to cues from the outside world and from within through exquisite collaborations between cells. For example, the cells lining our airways communicate with sensory neurons in response to chemical and mechanical signals, and evoke key reflexes such as coughing. This cellular collaboration protects our airways from damage and stabilizes breathing, but can become dysregulated in disease. Despite their vital importance to human health, fundamental questions about how sensory transduction is accomplished at these sites remain unsolved. We use the mammalian airways as a model system to investigate how physiological insults are detected, encoded, and addressed at essential barrier tissues with the ultimate goal of providing new ways to treat autonomic dysfunction. Sara Prescott will begin her appointment in early 2022.
