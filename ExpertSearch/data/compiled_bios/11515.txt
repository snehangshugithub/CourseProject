She received her PhD degree at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. After graduation, she joined Duke University as a postdoctoral associate to study the neural mechanism underlying reward-guided behaviors. Later, she studied the signal processing and network dynamics of visual attention at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Before joining the MTU, she worked as a research scientist in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Duke University to study brain mechanisms of deep brain stimulation in Parkinsons disease. Dr. Yus research focuses on understanding signal processing networks of sensory and motor systems and developing biomedical devices to treat neurological disorders. Her research employs various neural engineering and neurobiological approaches, such as programming and computational modeling, electrical stimulation, optogenetics, electrophysiology, behavioral assays, and neuroanatomy, to understand and manipulate brain circuits in preclinical animal models. Currently, Dr. Yu is developing novel strategies to optimize the therapeutic efficiency and efficacy of deep brain stimulation to treat Parkinsons disease. In the last three years, Dr. Yu has received research supports from NIH funds (R03 2018, and R15 2020) and MTU internal funds (Engineering Cross-Cutting Initiative 2018, C2E2 2019, and REF 2020).
