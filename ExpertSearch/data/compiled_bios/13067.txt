Chemical Engineering (summa cum laude), Ohio State University, Columbus, OhioResearch InterestsComplex kinetics modeling, catalysis and biocatalysis, polymerization and depolymerizationThe scientific motivation driving the work in my research group is unraveling complexity in reacting systems. We recognize that macroscopic observations are linked to microscopic phenomena, and analysis spanning these regimes provides the best opportunity for fundamental understandingand development of novel engineering strategies. The systems that we study, however, are sufficiently complex that the atomic-scale events leading to the observed behavior are obscured. We concentrate our efforts in three main topical areas using a combination of experiment and theory. Reaction systems that we model may consist of thousands of reactive intermediates and molecules and thus are too large for models to be developed without automated computer tools. Polymeric systems that we study require description of transformations of high molecular weight chains and evolution of low molecular weight products. Catalytic and biocatalytic systems that we investigate demand quantification of the interaction energies between numerous species and complex catalytic environments. We therefore develop capabilities to facilitate quantitative analysis and description of complex systems at the macroscopic level, and we devise strategies and apply tools for probing and quantifying molecular-level events.Selected PublicationsKostetskyy, Pavlo; Coile, Matthew W.; Terrian, Joshua M.; Collins, Jake W.; Martin, Kevin J.; Brazdil, James F.; Broadbelt, Linda J., Selective production of glycolaldehyde via hydrothermal pyrolysis of glucose, Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis 149.Stadtherr, Mark A.; Allen, David T.; Ganesh, Hari S.; Dean, David P.; Vernuccio, Sergio; Edgar, Thomas F.; Baldea, Michael; Broadbelt, Linda J., Product Value Modeling for a Natural Gas Liquid to Liquid Transportation Fuel Process, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research 59(7):3109-3119.Terrell, Evan; Dellon, Lauren D.; Dufour, Anthony; Bartolomei, Erika; Broadbelt, Linda J.; Garcia-Perez, Manuel, A Review on Lignin Liquefaction, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research 59(2):526-555.Strutz, Jonathan; Martin, Jacob; Greene, Jennifer; Broadbelt, Linda; Tyo, Keith, Metabolic kinetic modeling provides insight into complex biological questions, but hurdles remain, Current Opinion in Biotechnology 59:24-30.Peng, Anyang; Kung, Mayfair C.; Brydon, Robert R.O.; Ross, Matthew O.; Qian, Linping; Broadbelt, Linda J.; Kung, Harold H., Noncontact catalysis, Science Advances 6(5).Yu, Ying; Zhu, Youlong; Bhagat, Mihir N.; Raghuraman, Arjun; Hirsekorn, Kurt F.; Notestein, Justin M.; Nguyen, Sonbinh T.; Broadbelt, Linda J., Mechanism of Regioselective Ring-Opening Reactions of 1,2-Epoxyoctane Catalyzed by Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, ACS Catalysis 8(12):11119-11133.Oakley, Lindsay H.; Casadio, Francesca; Shull, Professor Kenneth R.; Broadbelt, Professor Linda J., Modeling the Evolution of Crosslinked and Extractable Material in an Oil-Based Paint Model System, Angewandte Chemie - International Edition 57(25):7413-7417.Brydon, Robert R.O.; Peng, Anyang; Qian, Linping; Kung, Harold H.; Broadbelt, Linda J., Microkinetic Modeling of Homogeneous and Gold Nanoparticle-Catalyzed Oxidation of Cyclooctene, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research 57(14):4832-4840.Zhou, Xiaowei; Li, Wenjun; Mabon, Ross; Broadbelt, Linda J., A mechanistic model of fast pyrolysis of hemicellulose, Energy and Environmental Science 11(5):1240-1260.Yanez, Abraham J.; Natarajan, Pradeep; Li, Wenjun; Mabon, Ross; Broadbelt, Linda J, Coupled Structural and Kinetic Model of Lignin Fast Pyrolysis, Energy and Fuels 32(2):1822-1830.Greene, Jennifer L.; Waechter, Andreas; Tyo, Keith Edward Jaggard; Broadbelt, Linda J, Acceleration Strategies to Enhance Metabolic Ensemble Modeling Performance, Biophysical Journal 113(5):1150-1162.Dellon, Lauren D.; Yanez, Abraham J.; Li, Wenjun; Mabon, Ross; Broadbelt, Linda J, Computational Generation of Lignin Libraries from Diverse Biomass Sources, Energy and Fuels 31(8):8263-8274.Gao, Hanyu; Broadbelt, Linda J.; Konstantinov, Ivan A.; Arturo, Steven G., Acceleration of kinetic monte carlo simulations of free radical copolymerization, AIChE Journal 63(9):4013-4021.Zhou, Xiaowei; Li, Wenjun; Mabon, Ross; Broadbelt, Linda J, A critical review on hemicellulose pyrolysis, Energy Technology 5(1):52-79.Zhou, X.; Broadbelt, L.
