Seo is also an RStudio double-certified data science instructor and accessibility expert certified by the International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP). His research topics involve accessible computing, universal design, inclusive data science, and equitable healthcare technologies. As a learning scientist, data scientist, and engineer, his research focuses particularly on how to make computational literacy more accessible to people with dis/abilities using multi-modal data representation. He has worked on various research and development projects on accessible computing and assistive technologies. His research projects have involved not just web accessibility, but also human-centered design and development studies including inclusive makerspaces, tangible block-based programming, tablet-based haptic feedback of knowledge structure, accessible data science (e.g., data tactualization, sonification, and verbalization), and accessible/reproducible scientific writing tools for people with and without dis/abilities. Seo obtained his PhD and M.Ed in Learning, Design, and Technology at the Pennsylvania State University, and double BA in Education and English Literature from Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, South Korea.
