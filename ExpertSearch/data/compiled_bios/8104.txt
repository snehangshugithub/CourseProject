She plans to combine her expertise in Computational Materials Science and Experimental Quantum Optics to predict, fabricate, and image quantum emitters for integration with photonic and nano-mechanical devices. Her research will focus on developing quantum materials including 2D materials, semiconductor quantum dots, and hybrid quantum systems that are relevant for applications in quantum computation, communication, and quantum sensing-based technologies. She obtained a Ph.D. in Materials Science in 2018 from the University of Rochester. She obtained a dual MS and MTech in Nanophysics and Nanostructures from the University of Delhi, India, and Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble, France. She obtained her BSc Honors in Physics in 2009 at Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India. Awards Carl E.
