Read the AI-enhanced cybersecurity research highlight. Extended funding to model next-generation 911 emergency communications The National Security Agency grant to model next-generation 911 emergency communications systems has been extended with an additional $150,000. The initial grant of $150,000 was awarded in 2020 to Principal Investigator and Professor Dr. Michael Stiber. Dr. Barbara Endicott-Popovsky, executive director of the Center for Information Assurance & Cybersecurity, is the co-investigator. Dr. Stiber also secured funding support from InterPARES Trust AI to develop a repository of emergency communications data (911 in the US). Researchers are looking to apply AI techniques to that data to infer real world events from the emergency calls made and to help us understand how cyber-attacks could effect emergency communications. This project is in collaboration with colleagues Erik Borglund (Mid Sweden University), Megan Cohen (University of British Columbia), Barbara Endicott-Popovsky (UW), Arika Kaneko (University of British Columbia), Scott Sotebeer (USA Strategics), and Samuel Tweneboah-Koduah (Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration). InterPARES Trust AI is housed at the University of British Columbia and is a multi-national interdisciplinary project aiming to design, develop, and leverage Artificial Intelligence to support the ongoing availability and accessibility of trustworthy public records.
