Upon graduation, she joined the Institute of Information Sciences of Academia Sinica (Taipei, Taiwan) as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow. She joined Texas State as an Assistant Professor in 2000, and was promoted to Associate Professor in 2006. Her research interests include graph theory, linear algebra and combinatorics, and she is particularly interested in applications arising from science and engineering. In the last 4 years, her research has been strongly supported by the NSF Math Institutes: she has done research visits to IMA, IPAM (twice), ICERM (twice) and AIM (4 times). She has also received grants from NSF, NSA, AMS, MAA and AWM. She has served as associate editor for several journals and book series, including The American Mathematical Monthly, and the AWM Springer Series in Mathematics.
