I am in particular interested in how their constituents, the quarks and the gluons (partons), share the momentum and spin of their parent nucleon. The region of large parton fractional momentum is especially important because there the partons behavior is determined by the effects of a phenomenon called "color confinement", whereby particles carrying a "color" charge, such as quarks and gluons, cannot be detected in isolation but can only live inside a color-neutral particle such as protons, neutrons and pions. This region can be probed in high-energy electron-nucleon or nucleon-nucleon collisions but require a careful study of a number of theoretical corrections to perturbative QCD computations of these processes. I am also interested in collisions on nuclear targets, where parton distributions are modified compared to a nucleon due to an intricate interplay of parton dynamics and nuclear effects which has so far eluded a universally accepted theoretical explanation. Experimental data from a number of different processes can then be used to produced a global QCD fit of parton distribution functions with greatly increased precision in the large fractional momentum region, and these can then be used in the computation of QCD backgrounds to searches for new physics at Tevatron (Fermilab) and the LHC (CERN, Geneva), and to neutrino oscillation experiments, among others. Likewise, via global fits, data from these high-energy physics experiments can be used to constrain the non perturbative structure of the hadron, and the interactions of proton and neutrons inside a nucleus. In these investigations, I enjoy a close collaboration with several experimental colleagues at Hampton U., Jefferson Lab, and elsewhere; I also provide theoretical support for experimental data analysis and interpretation, and new experimental proposals at Jefferson Lab and elsewhere. Furthermore, I am studying the effects of color confinement in the the space-time evolution of the hadronization process in high-energy scatterings on nuclear targets, whereby a parton momentarily freed from its parent nucleus by a hard scattering has to neutralize its color and form one or more hadrons before detection. Understanding the dynamics of color confinement is a complementary approach to hadron spectroscopy, which studies the effects of color confinement long after this has set in. Yet another way of studying color confinement is to study a deconfined state of quark and gluons, called the Quark-Gluon Plasma, created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions; its properties can be accessed by utilizing as probes high-energy particles created in the same collision. While I do not actively participate in this research anymore, understanding the hadronization process in ordinary nuclei is essential to unravel the vast amount of data on heavy-ion collisions produced at the SPS accelerator at CERN, and the RHIC accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory. With the new LHC data on the highest-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions ever there is plenty to learn about. Finally, I started my adventure in physics trying to understand color confinement from first principles by rewriting the QCD theory in terms of a topological field theory describing its non perturbative aspects, plus a term which describes the behavior of point-like gluons and quarks. My research interests have changed over time, but the first love is never forgotten.
