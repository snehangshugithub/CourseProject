He is also interested in the behavior of jets and/or droplets of complex fluids during ejection from microscopic orifices, which is critical to applications as disparate as biological sample preparation and additive manufacturing. Biography Professor Meacham joined the faculty at Washington University in 2014 after founding and serving as president and CEO for OpenCell Technologies, an early-stage company developing intracellular nanomaterial delivery tools for life sciences researchers. Previously, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow with Drs. David Ross and Laurie Locascio in the Biochemical Sciences division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and completed doctoral research under the guidance of Drs. Andrei Fedorov and Levent Degertekin at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Professor Meacham is recipient of a National Research Council Postdoctoral Research Associateship (2006), Georgia Tech Institute Fellowship (2002), and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (2002). He holds Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Iowa State University (received in 1999 and 2002, respectively).
