B. Miller Faculty W.M. Keck Foundation Professor of Electrical Engineering Professor of Applied Physics by Courtesy Director, Solid State and Photonics Laboratory Sites Stanford ProfileWebsiteCVResearch Areas:PhotonicsDescription of Interests: David Millers research interests include the use of optics in switching, interconnection, communications, computing, and sensing systems, physics and applications of quantum well optics and optoelectronics, and fundamental features and limits for optics and nanophotonics in communications and information processing. Bio: David Miller (B. Sc., St. Andrews, Ph.D., Heriot-Watt) is the W. M. Keck Professor of Electrical Engineering, and Professor by Courtesy of Applied Physics at Stanford University. Before Stanford, he was with Bell Laboratories from 1981 to 1996, as a department head from 1987. His interests include nanophotonics, quantum-well optoelectronics, and optics in information sensing, interconnects, and processing. He has published over 280 scientific papers, holds over 75 patents, has a Google h-index of over 100, is the author of the textbook Quantum Mechanics for Scientists and Engineers (Cambridge, 2008), and has taught open online quantum mechanics classes to over 50,000 students. He was President of the IEEE LEOS (now Photonics Society) in 1995, and has served on Boards for various societies, companies, and university and government bodies.He was awarded the OSA Adolph Lomb Medal and the R. W. Wood Prize, the ICO International Prize in Optics, the IEEE Third Millennium Medal, and the 2013 Carnegie Millennium Professorship. He is also a Fellow of APS, OSA, IEEE, the Electromagnetics Academy, the Royal Society of London and the Royal Society of Edinburgh, holds two Honorary Doctorates, and is a Member of the US National Academies of Sciences and of Engineering.
