Molly earned her Ph.D. in Engineering Education at Purdue University in 2018 working under advisors Dr. enay Purzer and Dr. Robin Adams. During this time, Molly was awarded the College of Engineering Outstanding Research Award and was a Bilsland Fellow. Mollys research focuses on student designer trade-off decisions through the study of their design actions and thinking. She earned her B.S. in General Engineering (Systems Engineering & Design) and M.S. in Systems and Entrepreneurial Engineering, both from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Prior to pursuing her Ph.D., she worked as an environmental engineer specializing in air quality, influencing her focus in engineering design with environmental concerns.
