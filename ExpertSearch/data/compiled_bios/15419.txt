With a background in sociology, film studies, and games studies, Dr. Boudreau has published on a range of subjects around digital games, players, game culture, and games user research. Dr. Boudreaus current research spans several areas including exploring the changing nature of mediated forms of sociality in digital gameplay, the concept of player/avatar hybridity developed through the networked process of play, as well as addressing different issues around toxic and problematic behavior in video game play and culture.
