Students are provided with opportunities for Internships, Placements, Pre-placement offers (PPO) in core companies and ITES. Some of the major recruiters and/internships for the department areBaxter,BIS Research,Siemens Healthineers, Bangalore,Medtronic,Philips Innovation,GE Healthcare etc. PROGRAMS The Department of Biomedical Engineering, MIT offers the following programs: B.Tech - Biomedical Engineering B.Tech. in Biomedical Engineering (BME) involves theapplication of the principles and problem-solving techniques of engineering and science to biology and medicine to design and develop systems as well as applications. Biomedical Engineering students have an opportunity to work on real-life problems and healthcare.The curriculum offers subjects such as biomedical instrumentation, medical signals and image processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, biomaterials & Tissue engineering, and nanotechnology to keep them in sync with advances in technology and prepare them for lifelong learning. The curriculum is designed to provide flexibility for students to opt for minor specialization offered by the department and online courses by reputed international universities. M.Tech - Biomedical Engineering M. Tech in BME offered by the Biomedical Engineering Department provides a platform for the graduate students to strengthen their foundations in biomedical engineering and gather a diversified exposure to the latest know-how in technology. The two-year full-time post-graduate program is learner-centric, industry-oriented, and research-driven. Thus, providing a great educational choice for engineers who want to upskill for a career boost in industry or step ahead for a career in research.
