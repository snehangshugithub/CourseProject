Dr Bishop completed her PhD in mathematics education at the University of Texas, has both her undergraduate and master's degrees in mathematics, and is a certified secondary mathematics teacher. Before joining the faculty at Texas State University in the Fall of 2016, Jessica was a faculty member at San Diego State University and the University of Georgia. She also taught high school mathematics for four years. Jessica has taught a wide range of university courses, but her primary work has been with practicing and prospective mathematics teachers to help equip them to better attend to and support their students' mathematical thinking. Jessica's research interests are concentrated in two areas: research on classroom discourse and research investigating children's mathematical thinking. She uses both qualitative and quantitative approaches to identify patterns in teacher-student and student-student discourse to better understand how discourse influences mathematics learning and the development of positive mathematics identities. She is currently working on an NSF CAREER grant focused on middle grades mathematics discourse and recently finished an NSF grant exploring K-12 students' conceptions of integers (http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/CRMSE/projectz/ ).
