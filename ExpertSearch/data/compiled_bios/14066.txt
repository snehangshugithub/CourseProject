The research and teaching activities of the faculty members and staff are divided into seven departments. This is in addition to the Business Education division as well as the Center for Business Ethics. Business Ethics is a permanent element of the curriculum and is represented across all departments in both research and teaching by the Center for Business Ethics. The content profile is in line with the fields traditionally dealt with within the Faculty as well as the economic structure of the Frankfurt/Rhein-Main region. The approximately 70 professors ensure a diversity and breadth of research and teaching fields rare nationwide.AccountingEconomic Policy & Quantitative Methods Business Informatics and Information EconomicsFinanceManagement and MicroeconomicsMarketingMoney and MacroeconomicsBusiness Education (German Website) About UsMission StatementDean's OfficeDepartments / DivisionsEconomic Policy & Quantitative MethodsFinanceMoney and MacroeconomicsManagement and MicroeconomicsMarketingAccountingBusiness Informatics and Information EconomicsBusiness EducationFaculty A-ZCampusDirectionsContactImprint In this section Home Faculty Departments / Divisions Economic Policy & Quantitative Methods Finance Money and Macroeconomics Management and Microeconomics Marketing Accounting Business Informatics and Information Economics Business Education Related section About Us Mission Statement Dean's Office Departments / Divisions Faculty A-Z Campus Directions Contact Impressum Top-Links Course CatalogueExamination OfficeLibraryOLATPublications DatabaseSSIX Info CenterStudent Counselling and Advisory News 29.11.2021 Princeton University and HEC Paris are now also relying on LiveX 02.11.2021 New mentoring program for young female scientists started at the Faculty of Economics and Business 29.10.2021 UBS Nobel Perspectives live! at Goethe University ContactGoethe University Frankfurt Faculty of Economics and Business Street address:Campus Westend Theodor-W.-Adorno-Platz 460323 Frankfurt am MainGermany Postal address:60629 Frankfurt am MainGermany Phone: +49 (0)69/798-34601 Fax: +49 (0)69/798-35000 Directions Connect with us on FacebookInstagram FacultyFacts and FiguresDean's OfficeDirectionsContact Study ProgramsBachelorMasterDoctoratePh.D. Programs ResearchPublicationsClusters and CentersPromotion of Young Researchers InternationalForeign Languages for EconomistsStudying AbroadInternational Exchange Students Press & MediaInformation Feeds Accreditations Goethe University Frankfurt Imprint Data protection 2004-2021 Goethe-Universitt Frankfurt am Main Top
