Exploiting ultrashort light pulses from the THz to x-ray range, his lab delves into the emergent behavior of superconductors, magnets, ferroelectrics, and other complex systems when driven out-of-equilibrium. The group is especially interested in studying non-equilibrium processes in artificially engineered heterostructures with atomic dimensions, aiming to design new non-equilibrium functionalities that will enable next-generation computing and energy technologies.Condensed Matter and Material PhysicsOptical Physics and Quantum Information ScienceSelected PublicationsJournal ArticleEngineering Crystal Structures With LightA.
