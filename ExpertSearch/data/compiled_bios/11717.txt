Harvard Divinity School, 1988Ph.D. The University of Chicago, 1993N.I.H. Postdoctoral Fellow, California Institute of Technology, 1993-1995 "The Fraser group conducts interdisciplinary research exploring the interactions between synthetic materials and their surroundings." Cassandra L. Fraser, Professor of Chemistry, Biomedical Engineering Professor Cassandra L Fraser from University of Virginia joined the editorial board of Materials Chemistry Frontiers in 2016. She specializes in responsive materials for imaging, sensing and detection, specifically oxygen sensing biomaterials, mechanochromic luminescence materials and polymeric metal complexes. Cassandra Fraser holds degrees from Kalamazoo College (BA 1984), Harvard Divinity School (MTS 1988) and The University of Chicago (PhD 1993, advisor: Brice Bosnich). She was an NIH postdoctoral fellow with Robert Grubbs at the California Institute of Technology (1993-5). Fraser is current a Professor of Chemistry at the University of Virginia, with joint appointments in Biomedical Engineering and the School of Architecture. At UVA, she was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, an NSF CAREER Award, an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship, and young professor awards from Dupont and 3M. Her teaching and mentoring accolades include the Cavaliers Distinguished Teaching Professorship and induction into the University Teaching Academy.

Google Scholar Courses Taught CHEM 2410 Organic Chemistry I CHEM 2420 Organic Chemistry II Featured Grants & Projects Fraser group projects The Fraser group and our extensive collaborative network conduct interdisciplinary research exploring the interactions between synthetic materials and their surroundings. In the laboratory we design and synthesize new materials with distinctive properties. We tailor these systems to address fundamental questions in science and adapt them for specific practical applications. Consideration of environmental and other societal dimensions of the materials fabrication process are also important to us, both intellectually and in the research enterprise in our laboratory. We adopt a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach, encourage cooperative learning and initiative, and tailor educational and research programs to suit the interests and goals of group members.
