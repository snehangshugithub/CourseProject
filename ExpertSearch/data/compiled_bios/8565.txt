Korngiebel Diane M. Korngiebel, DPhil Assistant Professor, Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education Adjunct Assistant Professor, Bioethics and Humanities dianemk@uw.edu Interests: User-centered design, ethical issues in Big Data science, shared-decision making, ethically informed genomic medicine, mHealth broadly construed (e.g., patient portals, smartphone applications, voice user interface/smart speakersparticularly to support older and diverse populations), and health equity. Background: Dr. Korngiebel has expertise in qualitative thematic and content analysis acquired through formal training for a doctoral degree by research (history) and experience analyzing a variety of biomedical data, including interview and focus group transcripts and survey responses. She is certified in User-Centered Design. Research: Dr. Korngiebel works at the intersection of bioethics, genomic medicine, and informatics. She is the PI on a grant whose aim is to identify and feasibility test a tool to support screening for heritable colorectal cancer (e.g., Lynch Syndrome) that can be deployed in low-resourced settings. She is also the PI on a grant that explores the ethical issues inherent in returning genetic test results to patients electronically using patient portals.
