He is the co-author of the book Learning in Neural Networks: Theoretical Foundations. He has served as associate editor of the journals Machine Learning, Mathematics of Control Signals and Systems, the Journal of Machine Learning Research, the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, and the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory. He was awarded the Malcolm McIntosh Prize for Physical Scientist of the Year in Australia for his work in statistical learning theory. He was a Miller Institute Visiting Research Professor in Statistics and Computer Science at U.C. Berkeley in Fall 2001, and a fellow, senior fellow and professor in the Research School of Information Sciences and Engineering at the Australian National University's Institute for Advanced Studies (1993-2003). He is also an honorary professor in the Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at the University of Queensland.
