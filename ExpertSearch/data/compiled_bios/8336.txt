He is the Director of the Center for Advanced Automotive Bio-Fuel Combustion Engines, a Graduate Automotive Technology Education (GATE) Center of Excellence funded by the Department of Energy.His research is building a basic scientific understanding of all that occurs during combustion within an engine. That knowledge will help automotive manufacturers meet emission standards. He focuses on diesel combustion, especially the elimination of two of the most difficult emissions to control: soot and nitrogen oxide. He developed a diagnostic process that facilitates real-time measurement of the amount of soot inside the cylinder. His computational models are among those that have enabled the automotive industry to make effective decisions about engine design without building and testing numerous prototypes.He is currently helping to develop a Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine, which relies upon low-temperature combustion to reduce emissions. He is also studying alternative fuels. Through the GATE Center of Excellence, he is conducting a comprehensive study of biodiesel-fueled engines under low-temperature combustion strategies. Working with Professor Alan Hansen of the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering and MechSE colleague Dimitrios Kyritsis, Professor Lee plans to provide detailed information on the performance and emissions of biodiesel in low-temperature combustion engines through computational modeling of fuel sprays in combustion; experimental investigations of biodiesel in a metal engine running in HCCI mode; and visualization of combustion, soot evolution and nitrogen oxide formation in an optical engine. The study will improve understanding of such fundamental mechanisms as fuel-air mixing, low-temperature ignition and combustion chemistry processes, and will profoundly impact the commercialization of biodiesel in the United States.
