In particular, he has worked on algorithms for integrated learning and reasoning (e.g., in common sense reasoning) and on a theory of communication in the absence of standards (introductions available in three lengths, short, medium, and long). His interests also lie in theoretical computer science more broadly construed. Biography Professor Juba graduated from MIT in September 2010 and subsequently worked as a postdoc under the supervision of Leslie Valiant, PhD, at Harvard until joining Washington University in fall 2014. He had also remained affiliated with MITs Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) as a postdoc with the National Science Foundation's Center for Science of Information through Summer 2012.
