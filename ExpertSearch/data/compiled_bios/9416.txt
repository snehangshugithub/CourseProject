Green Street Urbana, IL 61801 (217) 333-8937 weichsel@illinois.edu Research AreasAlgebra Edit Your Profile Professor Emeritus Research InterestsAlgebraic graph theory, graph theory, combinatorial group theory, combinatorics. Research DescriptionI am interested in the algebraic aspects of graph theoretical problems such as automorphism groups of graphs, the various matrices associated with graphs and representing graphs as algebraic objects such as vector spaces. In particular, I study distance transitive and distance regular graphs in a variety of contexts. I am also interested in the applications of these ideas to questions in computer science and communications.
