Mechanistic study plays a central role in the development of these new transformations. Projects in our group involve: design of new catalysts and catalytic transformations identification of important applications for selective catalytic processes elucidation of new mechanistic principles to expand powerful existing catalytic reaction manifolds Researchers in our group can expect to gain expertise in synthetic organic chemistry, reaction kinetics and mechanistic study.
