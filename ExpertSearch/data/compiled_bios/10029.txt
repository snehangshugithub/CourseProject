Teaching Techniques for Computer Science, Fr 2:00PM - 3:59PM, Soda 438 Biography Armando Fox is a Professor in Berkeley's Electrical Engineering & Computer Science Department as well as the Faculty Advisor for Digital Learning Strategy in the office of the Vice Chancellor for Undergraduate Education (VCUE). His current research is at the intersection of digital learning (especially but not exclusively in Computer Science), programming systems, and software engineering. He co-designed and co-taught Berkeley's first Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) and serves as Faculty Advisor to the MOOCLab. He also serves on edX's Technical Advisory Committee, helping to set the technical direction of their open MOOC platform. In 2015, he received the ACM Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award for his contributions to MOOCs, in particular in software engineering education, where his contributions include co-authoring the award-winning textbook Engineering Software as a Service: An Agile Approach Using Cloud Computing with Turing Award winner Prof. David Patterson.Prof. Fox is also passionate about diversity in computing, and serves as the Equity Officer for CS Graduate Admissions, a Campus Equity Advisor, the Berkeley liaison to the NSF FLIP Alliance, and a faculty sponsor of the CS Scholars program, and has been a keynote speaker at the Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing.While at Stanford he received teaching and mentoring awards from the Associated Students of Stanford University, the Society of Women Engineers, and Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society. He has been a "Scientific American Top 50" researcher, an NSF CAREER award recipient, a Gilbreth Lecturer at the National Academy of Engineering, and an ACM Distinguished Scientist. In previous lives he helped design the Intel Pentium Pro microprocessor and founded a successful startup to commercialize his UC Berkeley Ph.D. research on mobile computing. He received his other degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from MIT and the University of Illinois. He is also a classically-trained musician and performer, an avid musical theater fan and freelance Music Director, and bilingual/bicultural (Cuban-American) New Yorker living in San Francisco.Personal Homepage: http://www.armandofox.com/ Selected Publications A.
