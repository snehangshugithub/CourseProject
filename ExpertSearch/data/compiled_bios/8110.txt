She is an affiliate professor in the UD Department of Physics and Astronomy and the co-director of the UD Materials Growth Facility. She received her B.S. degree in Physics in 2006 from Iowa State University and her Ph.D. in Physics in 2012 from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. She worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign before joining the faculty at the University of Delaware in 2014. Awards International Conference on Molecular Beam Epitaxy Young Investigator Award, 2020 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, 2019 NSF EPSCoR RII Track-4 Fellowship, 2019 American Vacuum Society Peter Mark Memorial Award, 2019 Department of Energy Early Career Award, 2017 North American Molecular Beam Epitaxy (NAMBE) Young Investigator Award 2016 Research Interests Dr. Laws research group focuses on understanding and synthesizing quantum materials and heterostructures to realize devices with novel, designer photonic properties. Most of our research focuses on working with long wavelength light from the mid-infrared through the terahertz. Our materials can squeeze light into tiny volumes, make light bend backward, and slow light down. These devices have applications in thermal and biological imaging, infrared and terahertz detectors, chemical sensing, environmental monitoring, security and defense, and quantum computing. The materials and structures we create are grown using molecular beam epitaxy, a technique in which a material is grown one atomic layer at a time3D printing at the nanoscale. With this technique, we can create extremely high quality materials and complicated structures. Molecular beam epitaxy is widely used in industry to create lasers and light emitting diodes, among other devices. The MBE growth is done using the Materials Growth Facility at UD. After growth, the materials are characterized using the shared equipment in the Advanced Materials Characterization Lab, the Center for Advanced Microscopy and Microanalysis, and the University of Delaware Nanofabrication Facility.
