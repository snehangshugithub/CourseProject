His textbook, Deductive Logic, was published in 2003.Among his principal papers are "Logic in the Twenties: the Nature of the Quantifier" (1979), "The Undecidability of the Gdel Class with Identity" (1984); "Poincare Against the Logicists" (1987), "Russell's Reasons for Ramification" (1988), and "Frege's Conception of Logic" (2001); "I Want You to Bring Me a Slab: Remarks on the Opening Sections of the Philosophical Investigations" (1983), "Kripke on Wittgenstein on Rules" (1985), "Wittgenstein on Understanding" (1992), and "Wittgenstein on Fixity of Meaning" (1997).
