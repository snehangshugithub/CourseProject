Current research concerns three broad areas: (i) Active materials such as shape-memory alloys, ferroelectrics and liquid crystal elastomers, (ii) Heterogeneous materials and designing unprecedented properties by exploiting heterogeneities, (iii) Coarse-grained density functional theory to understand defects in solids. List of Research Areas mechanics of materials, continuum mechanics, active materials, shape-memory alloys, heterogeneous materials, density functional theory MCE News about Kaushik Bhattacharya Kaushik Bhattacharya Receives Theodore von Krmn Prize Caltech Announces the Schmidt Academy for Software Engineering Graduate Student Wins First Place At Ferro2019 Read more news about Kaushik Bhattacharya Is this your profile?
