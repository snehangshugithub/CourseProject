Prior to joining UF in 1998, he was a postdoctoral associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technologys Microsystems Technology Laboratories, Cambridge, MA from 1995-1998. He received a BS degree in 1989, a MS degree in 1992, and a Ph.D. degree in 1995 in Mechanical Engineering from Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY. During his Ph.D. studies he was a GSRP Fellow at NASA-LaRC in Hampton, VA from 1992-1995. Education Ph.D., 1995, Syracuse University Teaching Interests Acoustics, MEMS, Aerodynamics, and Fluid Mechanics Research Interests His current research focuses on the design, fabrication, and characterization of high-performance, instrumentation-grade, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based sensors and actuators that enable the measurement, modeling, and control of various physical properties. Specific applications include technology development to enable large-channel count micromachined directional microphone arrays for aeroacoustic noise source localization and miniature skin-friction sensors for aerodynamic drag characterization and flow control.
