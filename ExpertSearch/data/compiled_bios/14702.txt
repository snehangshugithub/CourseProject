StaffAlumniCompanies More About Northwestern Engineering RESEARCH & FACULTY Northwestern is a diverse and dynamic research institution whose innovations benefit millions of people around the world NewsHow Understanding Metallization of Materials Could Help the Development of Superionic Materials for Safe, Efficient BatteriesResearchers led by Professor Monica Olvera de la Cruz observed a classical system that exhibits a transition between insulating and conducting states, and hopes this will help the development of safe solid-state batteries.Shaping a Sustainable Future for a Common PlasticA research team including Professor Jennifer Dunn identifies new opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of polyurethane.New Holographic Camera Sees the Unseen with High PrecisionResearchers invented a new high-resolution camera that can see the unseen including around corners and through scattering media, such as skin, fog, or potentially even the human skull.Dancing Molecules Successfully Repair Severe Spinal Cord InjuriesIn a new study, researchers administered a single injection to tissues surrounding the spinal cords of paralyzed mice. Just four weeks later, the animals regained the ability to walk.All NewsCollaborative Researchexplore our networkCollaboration drives innovation Our world is changing at an accelerated pace, and the boundaries between disciplines are blurring. Under these dynamic conditions, we face global challenges at a scale never before seen. At Northwestern, we are making strategic investments in research areas that will drive our progress in the coming years. As these areas intersect, they provide focal points that connect our faculty and students throughout the school. In addition to collaborating with different schools and departments across campus and serving as a hub for Northwesterns interdisciplinary research efforts, engineering researchers have ongoing collaborations with dozens of universities, organizations, and research centers worldwide. These collaborations are changing the world and expanding the boundaries of our established knowledge.Key External CollaboratorsArgonne National LaboratoryThrough theNorthwestern-Argonne Institute for Science and Engineering (NAISE), engineering faculty regularly partner with researchers at Argonne National Laboratory, one of the nations oldest and largest science research centers and home to some of the most high-tech facilities in the world.Visit ArgonneNorthwestern MedicineNorthwestern engineers work closely with professors and physicians at the Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, and Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (NUCATS) to advance medical progress and inspire new partnerships.Visit Northwestern MedicineArt Institute of ChicagoNorthwestern Engineering partners with the Art Institute of Chicago to conduct scientific research and offer classes to advance the role of science within art history, curatorial scholarship, archaeology, and conservation, as well as use art to convey engineering research.Visit the Art InstituteShirley Ryan AbilityLabNorthwestern engineers collaborate frequently with the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, the nations top-ranked rehabilitation center, to design better rehabilitation robotics and artificial limbs.Visit the Shirley Ryan AbilityLabFacts and FiguresNorthwestern's engineering research enterprise funds more than 1,000 researchers in more than 250 labs. While the majority of Northwesterns research funding comes from government sources,corporate sponsoredresearch represents a growing opportunity for engineering professors. 1000+researchersacross more than 250 labs$128Mresearch expendituresfrom a diverse set of funding sources20.8%increase in research fundingin the past fiscal yearGlobal InitiativesCreating a worldwide network of researchersGlobal Initiatives help all Northwestern Engineering scholars including faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates to engage in the global marketplace of talents and ideas, developing research collaborations worldwide.Visit Global InitiativesPatent & Startup SupportBringing innovations to marketEngineering professors work with Northwesterns Innovation and New Ventures Office (INVO) to turn their research and innovations into patents and businesses. A hub for innovation, Northwestern Engineering is consistently responsible for more than half of all the Universitys invention disclosures and faculty startups.Visit the Innovation and New Ventures OfficeFacultyWorld-class expertsOur award-winning faculty, including many members of national academies, collaborate across disciplines to create new knowledge while maintaining a solid grounding in the fundamentals. They transfer their expertise and passion for their fields to every student and collaborator they work with as they continue to advance scientific and engineering knowledge.Meet our facultyCenters and InstitutesInnately interdisciplinaryNorthwestern Engineering institutes and centers cultivate talent, collaboration, and innovation at the intersection of disciplines.Centers Based in Northwestern Engineering Center for Advanced Regenerative Engineering (CARE) Center for Catalysis and Surface Science (CCSS) Center for Computation and Theory of Soft Materials (CCTSM) Center for Computer Science and Learning Sciences (CSLS) Center for Deep Learning (CDL) Center for Engineering Sustainability and Resilience (CESR) Center for Human-Computer Interaction + Design (HCI+D) Center for Innovation in Global Health Technologies (CIGHT) Center for Optimization and Statistical Learning (OSL) Center for Photonic Communications and Computing (CPCC) Center for Physical Genomics and Engineering (CPGE) Center for Quantum Devices (CQD) Center for Robotics and Biosystems Center for Smart Structures and Materials (CSSM) Center for Surface Engineering and Tribology (CSET) Center for Ultra-scale Computing and Information Security (CUCIS) Falk Center for Molecular Therapeutics Farley Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (FCEI) Northwestern Center for Engineering Education Research (NCEER) Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO) Northwestern University Transportation Center (NUTC) Segal Design Institute Engineering-Related Centers Reporting to Northwestern's VP of Research Argonne-Northwestern Solar Energy Research Center (ANSER) Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern Center for Bio-Inspired Energy Science (CBES) Center for Scientific Studies in the Arts Center for Synthetic Biology Innovation and New Ventures Office (INVO) Institute for Sustainability and Energy at Northwestern (ISEN) International Institute for Nanotechnology Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) Northwestern-Argonne Institute for Science and Engineering (NAISE) Northwestern Initiative for Manufacturing Science and Innovation Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (NUCATS) Querrey Simpson Institute for Bioelectronics Simpson Querrey Institute (SQI) All Northwestern Centers Northwestern SealMcCormick School of Engineering, Northwestern UniversityTechnological Institute, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL 60208view all contact infoAdmissionsFaculty DirectoryGive to McCormickTech Room Finder / MapsEmergency InformationNorthwestern HomeTech Lost and FoundReport an Accessibility IssueMcCormick on twitterMcCormick on facebookMcCormick on linkedinMcCormick on rssMcCormick on youtube 2021Robert R.
