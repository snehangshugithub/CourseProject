Gustavo Kunde Rohde, Associate Professor Dr. Rohde develops computational predictive models using machine learning and signal and image processing with applications in pathology, radiology, systems biology, and mobile sensing. He earned B.S. degrees in physics and mathematics in 1999, and the M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering in 2001 from Vanderbilt University. He received a doctorate in applied mathematics and scientific computation in 2005 from the University of Maryland. He is Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Virginia. Research in the Imaging and Data Science Lab aims to contribute ideas in support of biomedical imaging, mobile, and remote sensing applications. We specialize on objective and quantitative modeling of data from imaging and other types of sensors by incorporating knowledge from multiple disciplines including applied mathematics, signal processing, machine learning and statistics. Research Interests Medical and Molecular Imaging Signal and Image Processing Biomedical Data Sciences Computer Graphics and Vision Biomedical Data Sciences Machine Learning Gustavo Rohde, PhD, Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering In the News Machine Learning Technique Promises Early Detection of Osteoarthritis Published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and featured by CBS News, NIH, MSN, and more The research team investigated whether machine learning applied to MRI images of knee cartilage can point to early signs of osteoarthritis and predict who will develop the disease. The team used a customized machine learning technique invented in Rohdes lab called transport-based morphometry, an approach that quantifies information about the shape and texture of biological forms seamlessly from image data.
