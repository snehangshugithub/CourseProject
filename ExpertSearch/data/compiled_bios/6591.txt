This, in addition, to even more impressive developments algorithms allow us to obtain unique insights in the molecular behavior of many systems of scientific and technological interest. A central theme in our research is trying to understand how the environment influences the properties of these systems of interest. Experimentally it is very difficult to obtain information on molecules adsorbed in the nano-pores of a zeolite. From a scientific point of view it is important to understand how the environment is influencing the properties of these molecules. For these applications we have developed accurate models of the interactions between the molecules that allow us to mimic the experimental situation and to predict experimental properties, like, diffusion coefficients or adsorption isotherms. As the majority of the constituents of many everyday materials, from gasoline to a plastic PET bottle, have seen the inside of a zeolite catalyst, providing these molecular insights is not only of scientific importance. Proteins or peptides in a membrane have a very different environment from proteins in the cell. To understand how proteins interact in a membrane, multi-scale computational approaches are developed that allow us to study the effects of changes in the membrane structure on the collective behavior of these molecules.
