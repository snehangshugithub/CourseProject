Her research is aimed at advancing data services, especially for interdisciplinary inquiry. In this era of big data, she is particularly interested in optimizing the reuse value of small data and access to open data across disciplines. Her current projects include developing a framework for Site Based Data Curation and a model program for Data Curation Education in Research Centers. As an educator, she has been a leader in professional workforce development in data curation for nearly a decade, recognized in 2013 with the Information Science Teacher of the Year Award from the Association for Information Science & Technology.
