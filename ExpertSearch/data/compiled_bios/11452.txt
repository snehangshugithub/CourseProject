Glynn Holts research interests span a wide range of disciplines and involve physical acoustics, interfacial wave phenomena, nonlinear drop and bubble dynamics, surface and bulk rheology, therapeutic and imaging ultrasound, and the endless variety of cavitation phenomena from hydrodynamic and ultrasonic sources. Some (mostly) bubble highlights over a 30+ year career include the elucidation of chaotic sonoluminescence, turbulent and alligator-induced Faraday waves, bubble-enhanced heating, and the observation of a novel amorphous phase of water created by intense bubble collapse. On the drop side of things, he has employed acoustically-levitated drops as a means of observing dynamics, scavenging particles, inferring surfactant surface rheology as well as characterizing blood rheology for purposes of inferring disease and associated coagulopathy.
