The SoTeRiA Research Laboratory is a multi-disciplinary research team focusing on advancements of Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), pioneering three key areas of scholarly developments: (1) spatiotemporal coupling of physical failure mechanisms with human/social performance and generating an Integrated PRA (I-PRA) methodological framework, (2) incorporating big data analytics into PRA, and (3) integrating safety risk and financial risk. His current research interest includes the pipe failure rate estimation for advanced nuclear reactors, component reliability and availability prediction with explicit modeling of maintenance work processes and its coupling with physical degradation, and advancements of Fire PRA for nuclear power plants focusing on an efficient screening approach and multi-compartment fire analysis.Sakurahara holds a Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His Ph.D. research developed an Integrated Probabilistic Risk Assessment (I-PRA) methodological framework for Fire PRA of nuclear power plants by coupling a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) fire model with a human performance model for fire crew and integrating the fire-human coupling with the plant PRA model. For I-PRA, he also developed advanced techniques for importance measure analysis, the simulation-informed common cause failure modeling, and the Probabilistic Validation methodology for comprehensive uncertainty analysis. Sakurahara holds an M.Sc. in Nuclear Engineering and Management and a B.S. in Environment and Energy System Engineering from the University of Tokyo.
