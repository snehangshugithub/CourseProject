She and her team develop robotic tools and instruments and use spacecraft to study planets. Exploring Earths ice shelves and glaciers and the oceans beneath them, Schmidts team helps to capture the impacts of changing climate on the cryosphere, while understanding analogs for Ocean Worlds like Jupiters moon Europa.She received a B.S. in Physics from the University of Arizona, and PhD in Geophysics and Space Physics from UCLA. Schmidt has a long history of NASA spacecraft involvement, including the Dawn and Europa Clipper missions and the Europa Lander and LUVOIR Space Telescope mission concepts. She has conducted seven field seasons in Antarctica and one in the Arctic leading large science and technology programs. Her teams most recent projects have deployed the Icefin vehicle, built in her lab, to explore underneath the McMurdo and Ross Ice Shelf (NASA project RISE UP) and Thwaites Glacier, one of the fastest changing glaciers in Antarctica (NERC-NSF ITGC). Shell be joining the symposium on the tail end of a campaign to explore ground ice and water in Pingos in the Arcticanalogs for features on Mars and asteroids that may represent future in situ water resources, which the team will explore with candidate instruments for future robotic lander and human exploration.
