Computational modeling investigates the physical phenomena of a system using a mathematical model to describe the complex governing equations of the system. Computational modeling can be used to investigate the design, operation and degradation of complex systems. Professor Ryans research focuses on developing computational models of the reactive transport, fluid mechanics, heat transfer and electrochemistry in energy systems. With increasing energy costs and increasing concerns about the impact of society on the environment, cleaner, more efficient energy systems are needed. Professor Ryans research focuses on developing advanced computational models to study energy technologies, such as fuel cells and batteries. A primary area of research for Professor Ryan involves reactive transport in porous media which is central to many energy-related technologies such as fuel cells, battery technologies and subsurface transport. Her recent work has focused on investigating degradation in high temperature fuel cells, the operation of advanced battery technologies, and the design and operation of post-combustion carbon capture technologies.
