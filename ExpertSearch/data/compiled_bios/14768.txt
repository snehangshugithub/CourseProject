Since my childhood, earthquakes and volcanoes have motivated my curiosity to understand the secrets of our planet. My team study processes in our planets interior that produce magmas, volcanoes, and contribute to planetary evolution. Population growth, the risk of natural hazards, climate change, the need for new suitable energy solutions, increase the need for highly trained Earth scientists. My mission is to contribute to the education of the next generations so that we can bring solutions to these challenges.Research InterestsGazel works on solving the puzzles of the Earth by studying processes in the interior of our planet that produce magma and volcanoes. His goal is to understand how these processes contribute to planetary evolution and how they impacted life and the environment in the past in order to prepare for the future. Gazel's work integrates different Earth geochemical cycles, from ocean crust production to subduction and deep recycling, He studies these processes from a geochemical perspective complemented by interdisciplinary collaboration with other fields.Earth and Atmospheric ScienceGeochemistry, Petrology and VolcanologyTeaching InterestsDr. Gazel's teaching philosophy focuses on active learning. The use of actual data and case studies teach students tangible skills that they can use in their career fields. Gazel's strives to contribute to the education of the next generation of Earth science leaders who seek to find solutions for the challenges of the 21st century with population growth, natural hazards, climate change, and water and other natural resource challenges.Selected Awards and HonorsDaniel M.
