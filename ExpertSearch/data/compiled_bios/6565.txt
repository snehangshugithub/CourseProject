He also contributes to elements of AOE 3054 AOE Experimental Methods associated with the Stability Tunnel. His teaching, primarily conducted in lecture format, is based on a belief that effective teaching requires the instructor to understand the perspective of the students, and to put the material in a context that is meaningful and relevant to them. He greatly enjoys adding the historical or technical context of important concepts, and believes strongly that experiments in labs must be experimental (i.e. not demonstrations) and that they must meaningfully engage each individual student in deciding goals, determining how the experiment is conducted and reported.
