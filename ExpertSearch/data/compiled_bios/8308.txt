One is the opportunity to engage in a constant search for discovery, whether of new scientific phenomena or of solutions to practical problems. The second is the opportunity to share this love for discovery and intellectual growth with students and colleagues. I place significant emphasis on my role as a guide through the learning process, on making available to my students a framework for continued learning and discovery, on challenging them to achieve greatness, and on following them where they can thrive. I believe that learning is a great privilege and a great opportunity and that the responsibility that rests upon me as a teacher is immense. Research Statement Professor Dankowicz conducts dynamical systems research at the intersection of engineering, math and physics. This work involves studying a wide range of complex systems that are governed by differential equations and learning the behavior of those systems through theory and experiments. His research efforts further seek to make original and substantial contributions to the development and design of existing or novel devices that capitalize on system nonlinearities for improved system understanding and performance. A particular research focus of Prof. Dankowicz's group is the development of methods of modeling, simulation, analysis, and control of nonsmooth dynamical systems with applications to microelectromechanical devices, scanning probe microscopy, and biomechanics. In the area of microelectromechanical devices, recent research funding from the National Science Foundation supports an ongoing effort to design and fabricate ultrafast and robust limit-switch sensors whose operation and functionality relies on sudden changes in system response induced by the onset of low-velocity mechanical contact. In the area of scanning probe microscopy, research funding from the National Science Foundation has supported an industrial collaboration with Veeco Instruments in Santa Barbara, California, aimed at the modeling and control of tapping-mode atomic-force microscopy for improved imaging of soft natural or man-made structures. Prof. Dankowicz is a member of an interdisciplinary team that aims to develop novel quantitative algorithms for characterizing the spatiotemporal complexity of human locomotion and to identify, through a specific signature in the spatiotemporal coupling, neuro-muscular deficiencies. This work is an extension of past efforts on bipedal walking and an ongoing interest in bioassistive device technology. Through funding from the National Science Foundation, Prof. Dankowicz is also contributing to the formulation of standards of responsible conduct of computational modeling and research and to the dissemination of ideas of professional ethics and integrity in computational science to engineering graduate students in the form of teaching modules and case studies. Prof. Dankowicz further has an ongoing funded collaboration with the John Deere Technology and Innovation Center on the UIUC campus that targets model-based sensor and control design, for example, for John Deere harvest combines and foragers. This work offers unique opportunities for scientific discovery and engineering integration in a context with immediate industrial application. Finally, a significant emphasis of Prof. Dankowicz's work since 2006 is on the development of computational tools for intelligent exploration of the design space of nonlinear dynamical systems, including those modeling human cognition and behavior, complex societal network, and power systems. This collaborative effort has resulted in innovative advances in algorithm design and a powerful, general-purpose tool that is expected to greatly broaden the applicability of these methods to actual engineering design.
