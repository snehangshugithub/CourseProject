The core question in his research is: How can we bring material innovation in 2D atomic layers and 3D thin films towards ubiquitous electronics? A future hardware will entail ubiquitous electronics requires higher performance, mechanically lower stiffness and self-power. His recent studies have revealed unique and universal methodologies to produce large-scale, freestanding and single-crystalline exotic materials, which satisfy the aforementioned requirement. Based on the discoveries, his team mainly focuses on three directions; i) developing material building blocks, freestanding 3D films and 2D atomic layers, and discovering new 3D/2D physical coupling phenomena and functional architectures, ii) developing advanced solar cells with the study of solid-state photovoltaic physics and iii) heterogeneous integration for self-powered ubiquitous electronics with AI cognitive function.
