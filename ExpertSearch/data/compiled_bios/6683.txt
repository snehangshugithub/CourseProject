F. vonHelmholtz Career Development Professor in the Institute for MedicalEngineering and Science (IMES) and as Associate Professor in theDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). Heis also a principal investigator in the Computer Science andArtificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). Professor Sontagsresearch interests are in machine learning and artificialintelligence. As part of IMES, he leads a research group that aims totransform healthcare through the use of machine learning. Prior to joining MIT, Dr. Sontag was an Assistant Professor inComputer Science and Data Science at New York Universitys CourantInstitute of Mathematical Sciences from 2011 to 2016, and postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research New England from 2010 to2011. Dr. Sontag received the Sprowls award for outstanding doctoralthesis in Computer Science at MIT in 2010, best paper awards at theconferences Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP),Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI), and Neural InformationProcessing Systems (NIPS), faculty awards from Google, Facebook, andAdobe, and a NSF CAREER Award. Dr. Sontag received a B.A. from theUniversity of California, Berkeley. Degrees Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2010 S.M. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2007 B.A. in Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, 2005 Research Interests Professor Sontags research both aims to advance the field of machinelearning and artificial intelligence, and to apply these to transformhealthcare. Precision Medicine These are exciting times for the practice of medicine. The rapidadoption of electronic health records and has created a wealth of newdata about patients, which is a goldmine for improving ourunderstanding of human health. Our lab develops algorithms that usethis data to better understand disease progression and to facilitate new, precise treatment strategies for a wide range of diseases andconditions such as Type 2 diabetes, which affects tens of millions ofpeople worldwide every year, and multiple myeloma, a rare bloodcancer. In pursuit of these aims, a major methodological focus hasbeen on developing novel approaches to modeling high-dimensionaltime-series data, particularly approaches that bring togetherprobabilistic modeling and deep learning, and causal inference fromobservational data. Intelligent Electronic Health Records Todays electronic health records are predominately a place forrecording a patients health data. We aim to develop the foundationfor the next-generation of intelligent electronic health records,where machine learning and artificial intelligence is built-in to helpwith medical diagnosis, automatically trigger clinical decisionsupport, personalize treatment suggestions, autonomously retrieverelevant past medical history, make documentation faster and higherquality, and predict adverse events before they happen. A majorchallenge is the need for robust machine learning algorithms that aresafe, interpretable, can learn from little labeled training data,understand natural language, and generalize well across medicalsettings and institutions.
