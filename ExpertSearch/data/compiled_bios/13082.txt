Chemical Engineering (magna cum laude), University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PAResearch InterestsMolecular modeling, adsorption, separations, catalysis, energy and sustainabilityOur research focuses on adsorption, diffusion, and catalysis in nanoporous materials. We are interested in novel materials such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), as well as traditional materials such as zeolites that are already widely used in industry. Porous materials with well-controlled structures at the nanoscale can be extremely useful because of their ability to recognize and discriminate between adsorbed molecules. This leads to applications of nanoporous materials in adsorption separations, catalysis, membrane processes, sensing, and energy storage.Most of the projects in our group are aimed at solving problems related to energy and sustainability.Examples include development of materials to store hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles, development of materials for capturing carbon dioxide from power plant flue gas (carbon capture and sequestration), development of energy-efficient separations, development of highly selective catalysts for green chemistry processes, and harvesting water from air.To address these problems, we use powerful molecular modeling and machine learning techniques. Our goal is to develop a better understanding of surface interactions and dynamics in nanoporous materials and to exploit this molecular-level information to develop new, highly-selective processes in adsorption separations, catalysis, and energy storage. Another goal of our research is to develop new simulation methods that can handle an ever-broader range of time and length scales to address important problems that cannot be simulated with current techniques. We also collaborate closely with experimental research groups.Selected PublicationsSun, Yangzesheng; DeJaco, Robert F.; Li, Zhao; Tang, Dai; Glante, Stephan; Sholl, David S.; Colina, Coray M.; Snurr, Randall Q.; Thommes, Matthias; Hartmann, Martin; Ilja Siepmann, J., Fingerprinting diverse nanoporous materials for optimal hydrogen storage conditions using meta-learning, Science Advances 7(30).Li, Zhao; Bucior, Benjamin J.; Chen, Haoyuan; Haranczyk, Maciej; Siepmann, J.
