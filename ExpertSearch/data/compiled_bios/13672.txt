State Street Biography I am interested in the ways that design and innovation can be applied to a multitude of contexts, from community engagement projects to startups. I manage the Design Clinicprogram, which matches student teams with mentors and clients to help solve real-world information challenges. I also lead advising on innovation and entrepreneurship and enjoy working with students to explore the ways that design, creative problem-solving, and user-centric methods lead to positive impact and social change. I have nearly a decade of experience in international development, specifically in sub-Saharan Africa, and have run social impact programs in Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa.
