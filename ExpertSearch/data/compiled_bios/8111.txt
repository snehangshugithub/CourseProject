Our general research approach is to design and synthesize materials from the monomer up to precisely tune the macromolecular architecture. We then utilize an array of characterization techniques, such as rheometry, scattering, and microscopy, to better understand the relationship between the underlying microscopic structure and the macroscopic property. This latter process informs the direction for monomer design and synthesis to optimize the desired property for a specific application. Awards McNair Scholars Outstanding Advisor Award 2015 University of Delaware Research Foundation (UDRF) Award 2012 & 2014 Outstanding Teaching Assistant, 2001 Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, NCSU Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching Assistant, 1998 & 1999 Department of Chemical Engineering, CU Research Interests Stimuli-responsive materials, which include light-actuated, environmentally adaptable, and self-healing materials, for applications ranging from low stress and healable dental restoratives to photo-induced delivery of gene therapeutics. We utilize an array of synthetic approaches, from basic organic synthetic reactions to controlled polymerization, to fabricate these novel materials.
