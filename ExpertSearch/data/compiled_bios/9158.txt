Payne earned his B.Sc. (Hons.) in Ceramics from the University of Leeds in 1963. From 1963-65 he worked at Northern Electric Company, Montreal, Canada on ferromagnetic ceramics, and from 1965-67 at Sprague Electric Company, N. Adams, MA on ferroelectric ceramics. In 1967 he received his M.S. in Physics from Williams College, Williamstown, MA. From 1967-73 he was employed at Erie Technological Products, State College, PA on research and development of ceramic capacitors and earned his Ph.D. in Solid State Science from the Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA in 1973. His thesis advisor was Professor L. E. Cross. From 1973-74 Dr. Payne was a Post Doctoral Research Associate in the Materials Research Laboratory at Penn. State carrying out research on ferroelectricity. In 1974 Dr. Payne joined the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as an Assistant Professor of Ceramic Engineering (Assoc. Prof. '78, Prof. '81). He held several administrative appointments, including Head, Ceramic Engineering (1986-88); Acting Head, Materials Science and Engineering (1987-88); and Associate Director, Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology (1991-94). Interdisciplinary research professorships at UIUC include Microelectronics Center (1982-90), Cement Center (1984-1996), Science and Technology Center for Superconductivity (1987-98), and Beckman Institute (1989-1998). He held the Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals Chair in Frontier Chemistry in the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Tokyo, Japan (1989-90). Professor Payne's research is directed at electrical ceramics, ferroelectrics, piezoelectrics, ceramic processing, microstructure-property relations, crystal growth, materials chemistry, sol-gel processing, micro-contact printing, superconductors and magneto resistivity. He is active in the international electrical ceramics community and has held every officer position in the Electronics Division of the American Ceramic Society. Professor Payne has published more than 288 scientific papers and graduated 58 M.S. and Ph.D. students. Ten patents have been issued from the research. Research Interests The electrical ceramics research group is working on the crystal growth, chemical synthesis and ceramic processing of new and improved oxide materials for dielectric applications. Of particular interest are structure-property relationships for ferroelectric, piezoelectric and pyroelectric ceramics in single crystal and polycrystalline form, including nanocrystalline materials and thin-layer devices. Single crystals are grown by a variety of methods, including, Czochralski and flux growth, and the basic properties determined. Polycrystalline ceramics are prepared from chemically prepared powders with hot-pressing, and the role of microstructure and boundary conditions determined. Thin films are integrated with substrates by chemical solution methods, and the properties related with bulk values. Projects include: structure-property relations for PMN-PT piezoelectric crystals, phase transformations and microstructure development for Ta2O5 ceramics and Pb-free dielectrics.
