In 1996 he joined the Computer Engineering Group of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University. Prof. Meleis served as Associate Chair of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering from 2016 to 2019, asInterim Associate Dean for Graduate Education from 2019-2020, and has served as Associate Dean for Graduate Education since 2020.As Associate Dean, Prof. Meleis oversees recruiting, admissions, advising, academic operations, online instruction, and cooperative education for the College of Engineerings 30 masters and PhD programs, supporting over 4000 graduate students studying at our five campuses. Prof. Meleis supervises 18 staff members within the Graduate School of Engineering who support Boston-based programs.Prof. Meleis founded and advises Enabling Engineering, an innovative engineering student group that designs and builds devices to empower individuals with physical and cognitive disabilities. Participating students collaborate with clients on projects that provide greater independence, reduce medical burdens, and increase social connectedness. The group helps family members, clinicians, and teachers care for people with disabilities. By giving students the opportunity to participate in Enabling Engineering projects, the group is training the next generation of engineers to be knowledgeable about, and aware of, the needs of individuals with disabilities. The group has given more than 700 students from across the university the chance to work on 60 practice-oriented projects with clinical collaborators and community partners. The group is self-supporting, having received more than $350K in external funding. Enabling Engineering projects have been profiled by CNN, Engadget, Forbes, PC World, and Herald News.Prof. Meleis has been leading an innovative, interdisciplinary Dialogue of Civilizations trip to Italy and the UK on Scientific Revolutions since 2015. The goal of the Dialogue is to understand two revolutions in scientific thought, the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century and the Computational Revolution of the 20th century. The courses trace the evolution of science starting in ancient times, makes connections to the local environment, and then discusses practical implications of these ideas for modern scientists.EducationPhD, University of Michigan, 1996Honors & Awards2003: Martin W.

Prof. Meleis has supervised 6 PhD and 5 MS thesis students.Professor Meleis has developed and evaluated algorithms and bounds for combinatorially difficult optimization problems. He has made contributions to the following areas:Optimal scheduling and register allocation, with spill code, for multiple-issue processorsMicroprocessor-aware scheduling algorithms for modern compilersAlgorithms for weighted-completion time schedulingDesign and analysis of tight lower bounds on schedule lengthBacktracking acyclic schedulersParallel and scalable processing systems and programming toolsets.Computational infrastructure for seamless, inter-site Grid computingApplications of combinatorial optimization to switching, testing, and reconfigurable computingMultiagent machine learning for distributed combinatorial optimizationProf. Meleis developed a family of highly-effective function approximation algorithms based on Kanerva Coding that can be used to apply reinforcement learning to large-scale optimization problems. He then showed that these techniques can be successfully applied to to large-scale problems in multi-agent learning, network congestion control, and spectrum allocation for cognitive radio.Prof. Meleis is a founder of the Volunteer Science web platform to support large-scale social experimentation. The platform facilitates online experimentation by scholars across the social, behavioral, and economic sciences and the development of empirical studies, analytic engines, and long-term data storage and access for communal research. The project is funded by the Army Research Lab and currently supports more than 30 ongoing experiments. Users of the platform include researchers at Harvard, MIT, NYU, Johns Hopkins, Northeastern, Illinois, Univ. of Vermont, ARL, Northwestern, UCSB, and the Max Planck Institute.Prof. Meleis developed and evaluated assistive technology with colleagues in Bouve. This includes the FITBoard rehabilitation tool for children, where clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the tools effectiveness, and communication tools for children in Ecuador.Department Research Areas Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Algorithms Toggle Accordion Publications Selected PublicationsW.
