From 1991 to 1993 he was an Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Central Florida. In 1993 he joined the Pennsylvania State University, where he was promoted to Associate Professor in 1997 and to Professor of Electrical Engineering in 2001. In July 2006 he joined the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Northeastern University, Boston, MA, as the Dennis Picard Trustee Professor. He has also held visiting appointments at the California Institute of Technology in 1990 and 2000 and Adjunct Professor of Electrical Engineering at Penn State. His research interest include dynamics-enabled machine learning, robust control, control oriented identification, semi-algebraic optimization, and dynamic computer vision. He serves as Associate Editor for the journal Automatica, Editor in Chief for the Section on AI and Machine Learning Control of the journal Frontiers in Control Engineering, and Chair of IFACs Technical Committee on Robust Control.
