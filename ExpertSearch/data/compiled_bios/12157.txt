Professor Fowlers research focuses on electrochemical power sources in vehicles, specifically degradation analysis and control of batteries in hybrid and plug-in hybrid power trains. His interest takes him into the modelling of fuel cells and requires simulating the performance and reliability of fuel cells and batteries. Professor Fowlers research group is interested in performance evaluation, diagnostics, and forensics associated with fuel cell stacks, single cells and batteries. His study of fuel cell failure mode and reliability also encompasses the extensive development of polymers due to their function as the fuel cells electrolyte, gas diffusion layer and blending of polymers for conductive bipolar plates. One of the key questions to be addressed in the 'hydrogen economy' is the clean production and distribution of hydrogen. Through a series of publications and presentations, his work has furthered the concept of 'clean energy hubs' as distributed energy generation systems including wind and solar, and large scale systems with CO2 free nuclear energy as a key components of the hubs. Unique to this work is the consideration the integration of natural gas and electrical distribution systems through the Power to Gas concept of energy storage and distribution. This work has principally included hydrogen as an energy vector, but also considered the impact of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles within such clean energy hubs. His expertise in fuel cell technology has landed him the position of co-faculty supervisor of competitive vehicle team design projects; ChallengeX and EcoCar where he has supervised the development of two fuel cell vehicles, and two plug-in hybrid vehicle. Professor Fowler assists these teams with their design, construction, implementation and testing of hybrid vehicles. He also supervises other award winning student teams in the design of Green Energy Systems.Research InterestsGreen Reaction EngineeringPolymer ScienceInterfacial PhenomenaColloids & Porous MediaModelling of Hydrogen Energy Hubs and Power to Gas Energy StorageReliability Assessment of Electrochemical Storage SystemsDevelopment of Battery and Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Train Vehicles and Test BenchesEducation2003, Doctorate, Chemical and Materials Engineering (Fuel Cell Reliability), Royal Military College of Canada1995, Certificate in Environmental Assessment, Environmental Impact Assessment, Lakehead University1988, Master's, Engineering Chemistry (Polymer Processing), Queen's University, Kingston1986, Bachelor's, Fuels and Materials Engineering, Royal Military College of CanadaCourses*CHE 482 - Chemical Engineering DesignTaught in 2019CHE 483 - Group Design ProjectTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018CHE 499 - Elective Research ProjectTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018CHE 571 - Industrial EcologyTaught in 2016, 2017CHE 755 - Res Tpcs in Electrochem.
