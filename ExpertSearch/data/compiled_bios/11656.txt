He is also the lead researcher in The Waterloo Public Transportation Initiative (WPTI), which is a UWaterloo research group that provides expertise in urban transportation planning and engineering in order to address the challenges relevant to Canadian and global cities. Professor Casellos primary research interest is in the development and application of quantitative models of transportation (particularly transit and non-motorized modes) system performance. He is also interested in researching the impacts of transportation investments on land use patterns and has published extensively on these topics. Professor Casello specializes in the planning, design and operation of public transportation systems. He is the lead author (with Vukan R. Vuchic) of Transit Planning for the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) 3rd edition of the Transportation Planning Handbook. In addition, he is an acknowledged contributor to two seminal texts in the field: Urban Transit Systems and Technology and Urban Transit Planning, Operations and Economics, both by Professor Vuchic. Professionally, Professor Casello has worked as a consultant, instructor and researcher with many transit agencies in the US, Canada and abroad. These include Singapore (LTA), Washington DC (WMATA), Houston (METRO), Philadelphia (SEPTA), the Regional Municipality of Waterloo (GRT), the City of Kingston, and Mexico City (D.F.). He has also worked in the public sector for the New York State Department of Transportation.Research InterestsPublic TransportationUrban TransportationTransportation ModellingNon-motorized modesPublic transit and transportation planningTransportation EngineeringEnvironmental issues and new material economiesUrbanizationAlternative fuelsTransportation networksRenewable energyConnectivity and Internet of ThingsSmart communitiesBig data/analyticsIoTApplication domainsStakeholdersEducation2003, Doctorate, Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania1999, Master's, Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania1996, Master's, Transportation Engineering, Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute1992, Bachelor's, Civil Engineering Systems, University of PennsylvaniaCourses*CIVE 440 - Transit Planning & OpTaught in 2018, 2020CIVE 484 - Phys Infrastructure PlanningTaught in 2017, 2021CIVE 641 - Public TransportationTaught in 2018, 2020* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsNour, Akram and Hellinga, Bruce and Casello, Jeffrey, Classification of automobile and transit trips from Smartphone data: Enhancing accuracy using spatial statistics and GIS, Journal of Transport Geography, 51, 2016, 36 - 44Casello, Jeffrey M and Towns, Will and Blanger, Julie and Kassiedass, Sanathan, Public Engagement in Public Transportation Projects: Challenges and Recommendations, Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board(2537), 2015, 88 - 95Casello, Jeffrey M and Lewis, Geoffrey McD and Yeung, Kevin and Santiago-Rodrguez, Deborah, A Transit Technology Selection Model, Journal of Public Transportation, 17(4), 2014Casello, Jeffrey and Usyukov, Vladimir, Modeling Cyclists' Route Choice Based on GPS Data, Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board(2430), 2014, 155 - 161Dodero, Abel and Casello, Jeffrey and Molinero, Angel and Cotera, Daniel, Evaluating Private Bus Operators' Willingness to Participate in Transit Improvements in Mexico, Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board(2394), 2013, 119 - 127Graduate StudiesCurrently considering applications from graduate students.
