His work is driven by designing and analyzing multi-agent coordination algorithms that function well under challenging conditions, such as asynchronous information sharing, noisy communications, and user privacy requirements. His work deploys these algorithms on teams of flying and ground robots, providing both validation of the underlying theory and further research directions. He was named the MAE Departments Teacher of the Year for 2018-2019 and received an NSF CAREER Award in 2020.
