My lab accomplishes this by working with faculty, especially in introductory STEM courses, and collaborating with psychology researchers, other STEM education researchers and the Center for Science and Mathematics Education (CSME). My research also focuses on educating and supporting faculty in these areas to implement evidence-based strategies through developing on-line and in-person educational material and implementing faculty-development programs, and to document these changes through classroom observations and other evaluation instruments. The goal of our group is to help faculty create a classroom environment and curriculum where all students can succeed in and enjoy STEM.
