He is currently developing a mechanistic understanding of hydrogen embrittlement in pipeline steels to determine whether hydrogen fuel can be safely transported at enormous pressures through existing pipelines. These pipelines are formed from low-strength steel that deforms easily but also has high resistance to rupturing. He is particularly concerned with hydrogen embrittlement, in which materials fail catastrophically at much lower load levels than they can sustain in the absence of hydrogen. The steel in pipelines can have many impurities and inclusions, where hydrogen degradation can be initiated.He and Professor Ian Robertson of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering have used models and experiments to show that hydrogen embrittlement may result from a synergistic action between brittle and ductile failure. Their study of degradation in nickel alloy 690 is widely used in the nuclear energy industry and was the first systematic simulation of the synergistic action of hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity and hydrogen-induced decohesion.Professor Sofronis and his research group are also working with Sandia National Laboratories to develop a model of material response in the presence of hydrogen by accounting for and including all of its effects on microstructure that have been observed by Professor Robertson in the Transmission Electron Microscope. The result will be a much-needed and long-awaited tool for predicting hydrogen-induced failures through computer simulation. The researchers are also exploring ways to mitigate hydrogen fractures by hindering hydrogen ingress into materials, and they are investigating new material microstructures that are compatible with hydrogen.
