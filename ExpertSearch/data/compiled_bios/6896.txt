Full Research Description:My lab addresses basic questions about the propagation and differentiation of germ cells, using Drosophila. Germ cells protect, rearrange and pass on a species genome to the next generation. They undergo complex differentiation to become highly specialized cell types, the gametes. In Drosophila, as in other organisms, the development of the germ cells begins with germ stem cells. Each time a germ stem cell divides, one daughter cell retains the stem cell fate, while the other enters the oogenesis or spermatogenesis pathway. We are interested in how genes are regulated in germ stem cells and differentiating germ cells, and in particular the role of epigenetic factors in the biology of these cells. Much of our recent work stems from our discovery of a gene eggless (egg, also called dSetDB1) that is needed in germ cells. The protein from the gene, Egg, is required for methylation of histone H3 at its K9 residue (H3K9), during both oogenesis and spermatogenesis. We have recently shown that in the absence of the gene, germ stem cells are not maintained in adult flies, in both the ovaries and the testes. We are testing the hypothesis that the Egg protein normally establishes repressive chromatin domains at the promoters of specific genes, thereby establishing the necessary temporal pattern of gene expression in germ stem cells and their daughters. Current experiments are focused on identifying the direct gene targets of Egg, and the mechanism by which Egg finds these targets in the genome.
