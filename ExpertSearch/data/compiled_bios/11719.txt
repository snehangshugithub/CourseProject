Cornell University, 1996M.S. University of VirginiaPh.D. University of Virginia, Biomedical Engineering Post-Doc Internal Medicine residency Stanford University, General cardiology fellowship at Duke University Medical Center, One year research post in cardiovascular MRI Duke Cardiovascular MR Imaging Center "Dr. Salerno's research involves the development and evaluation of novel MRI techniques to improve the clinical utility of CMR imaging." Michael Salerno, Associate Professor of Medicine, Radiology and Biomedical Engineering After receiving his BS in biological engineering from Cornell University, Dr. Salerno came to UVA to pursue his MD degree and PhD in Biomedical Engineering as part of the Medical Scientist Training Program. He then completed the American Board of Internal Medicine Research Pathway completing his Internal Medicine residency at Stanford University, and his general cardiology fellowship at Duke University Medical Center. During his time at Duke he completed a dedicated year in cardiovascular MRI at the Duke Cardiovascular MR Imaging Center. He returned to UVA in 2008 to complete a 2-year advanced cardiovascular imaging fellowship where he trained in CMR as well as cardiovascular CTA. He achieved COCATS Level III training in all cardiovascular imaging modalities (Echo, Nuclear, CMR, CCT), and is board certified in Echocardiography and Nuclear Cardiology. In 2010 he joined the faculty as a clinical investigator in the Cardiovascular Medicine Division and holds joint appointments in Radiology and Biomedical Engineering. His research involves the development and evaluation of novel MRI pulse sequences and techniques to improve the clinical utility of CMR imaging. The current clinical focus of the research is on myocardial perfusion imaging, imaging of myocardial fibrosis and ventricular remodeling following myocardial infarction. His laboratory includes undergraduate and graduate engineering students as well as clinical cardiovascular imaging fellows to bring new advances into clinical practice. Dr. Salerno has been in the field of MRI for 16 years and holds multiple patents related to the development and application of novel pulse sequences for MRI. He has received numerous research awards, and has published extensively in the areas of MRI, cardiovascular MRI and multi-modality cardiovascular imaging. His research is supported by the AHA and the National Institutes of health. He is an invited reviewer for over 10 cardiovascular and imaging journals.

ABS O'Halloran RL, Holmes JH, Altes TA, Salerno M, Fain SB Google Scholar Featured Grants & Projects Echocardiography Lab Projects Dr. Salerno's research involves the development and evaluation of novel MRI pulse sequences and techniques to improve the clinical utility of CMR imaging. The current clinical focus of the research is on myocardial perfusion imaging, imaging of myocardial fibrosis and ventricular remodeling following myocardial infarction. The laboratory includes undergraduate and graduate engineering students as well as clinical cardiovascular imaging fellows to bring new advances into clinical practice. Our laboratorys research involves the development and evaluation of novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pulse sequences and techniques to improve the clinical utility of cardiovascular MRI (CMR). Our lab is an interdisciplinary group which includes undergraduate and graduate engineering students as well as clinical cardiologists and cardiovascular imaging fellows with the goal of bringing new advances into clinical practice. From an engineering perspective we are actively involved in the design and implementation of MRI pulse sequences and the development of new advanced image reconstruction and image processing techniques. The current clinical focus of the research is on myocardial perfusion imaging, imaging of myocardial fibrosis and multi-parametric imaging of ventricular remodeling following myocardial infarction. Students in the laboratory benefit from having the opportunity to directly apply new imaging techniques in human subjects, and to work along with physicians to create robust clinically relevant techniques. We also collaborate very closely with other investigators in BME and Cardiology including Dr. Frederick Epstein, Dr. Craig Meyer, Dr. Christopher Kramer and Dr. Kenneth Bilchek. Techniques for Whole-Heart Quantitative Assessment Developing improved techniques for whole-heart quantitative assessment of perfusion using spiral k-space pulse sequences and parallel imaging and compressed sensing reconstruction techniques. We are developing robust techniques for adenosine first-pass perfusion stress testing to improve diagnosis of coronary artery disease and to characterize microvascular disease. T1 Mapping Techniques Developing and applying T1 mapping techniques to assess diffuse myocardial fibrosis and optimizing strain imaging techniques to assess myocardial function in patients with heart failure with preserved EF (HF-PEF). The goal is to improve the diagnosis of HF-PEF and to guide the development of novel therapies for this disease. Myocardial Infarct Remodeling Study myocardial infarct remodeling in a closed-chest porcine model of myocardial infarction. This project utilizes advanced CMR techniques to quantitative characterize the remodeling process with the goal of developing novel therapies to prevent adverse cardiac remodeling and heart failure following myocardial infarction. T1 Mapping Apply T1 mapping and advanced strain imaging techniques to characterize inflammation, scarring and myocardial function in chemotherapy induced cardiotoxicity.
