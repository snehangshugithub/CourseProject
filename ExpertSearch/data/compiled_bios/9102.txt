Her research focuses on problems of biocompatibility with biomaterials and biomedical devices. While biomedical devices have significantly improved quality of life and increased life expectancy of millions of people, their use is not without complications such as infection, thrombosis and fibrosis. Although the overall rate of complications remains low, the consequences may have fatal outcomes. Research in Professor Gorbets lab aims to understand interactions between biomaterials and biological systems. A better understanding of the mechanisms of material-induced cellular activation will enable the design of materials and/or therapeutic strategies that improve biocompatibility and will hence reduce the risks of complications. Some of her research currently focuses on the mechanisms of material-induced thrombosis (blood clot formation) with mechanical heart valves and coronary stents. In-vitro models are being developed to characterize how the blood system (platelets, leukocytes and proteins) interacts with medical-grade metals to create a prothrombotic state. These results will later be used to develop in-silico thrombosis models. Professor Gorbet is also interested in the development of better in-vitro models that can help understand and solve material biocompatibility problems. These in-vitro models are used to identify the interactions between the material and biological systems and test hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of these interactions. These findings can then be verified in-vivo or in clinical settings. Ophthalmic biomaterials, such as soft contact lenses and keratoprosthesis, are currently the main focus of this research.Research Interestsbiocompatibilitybiomedical devicesbiomaterialsBiological Response to MaterialsErgonomicsHuman Factors & BiomedicalEducation2001, Doctorate, PhD, University of Toronto1993, Bachelor's, BASc, Universite de Technologie de CompiegneCourses*BME 161 - Intro to Biomedical DesignTaught in 2017BME 201 - SeminarTaught in 2017BME 202 - SeminarTaught in 2016BME 284 - Physiological & Biological SysTaught in 2016BME 301 - SeminarTaught in 2017BME 302 - SeminarTaught in 2017BME 361 - Biomedical Engineering DesignTaught in 2017, 2018BME 362 - Biomed Eng Design Workshop 1Taught in 2017BME 399 - Biomedical Research ProjectTaught in 2019, 2020BME 499 - Elective Biomed Research ProjTaught in 2019, 2020SYDE 285 - Materials ChemistryTaught in 2016, 2017SYDE 384 - Biological and Human SysTaught in 2019, 2020SYDE 584 - Biological & Human SystemsTaught in 2021SYDE 684 - Materials BiocompatibilityTaught in 2019, 2020SYDE 780 - Topics in Engineering SciencesTaught in 2018, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsGorbet, Maud and Willcox, Mark DP, Interactions of tear-film neutrophils with clinical bacteria., Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science, 56(7), 2015, 4048 - 4048Wong, Alexander and Wang, Xiao Yu and Gorbet, Maud, Bayesian-based deconvolution fluorescence microscopy using dynamically updated nonstationary expectation estimates, Scientific reports, 5, 2015Kazemzadeh, Farnoud and Jin, Chao and Molladavoodi, Sara and Mei, Yu and Emelko, Monica B and Gorbet, Maud B and Wong, Alexander, Lens-free spectral light-field fusion microscopy for contrast-and resolution-enhanced imaging of biological specimens, Optics letters, 40(16), 2015, 3862 - 3865Molladavoodi, Sara and Kwon, Hyock-Ju and Medley, John and Gorbet, Maud, Human corneal epithelial cell response to substrate stiffness, Acta biomaterialia, 11, 2015, 324 - 332Gorbet, Maud and Postnikoff, Cameron and Williams, Sara, The Noninflammatory Phenotype of Neutrophils From the Closed-Eye Environment: A Flow Cytometry Analysis of Receptor ExpressionNoninflammatory Phenotype of Tear Film Neutrophils, Investigative ophthalmology & visual science, 56(8), 2015, 4582 - 4591Graduate StudiesCurrently considering applications from graduate students.
