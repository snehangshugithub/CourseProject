He joined the University of Essex as Lecturer in mechatronics in 2019. Before joining Essex, he was a research fellow at STORM Lab University of Leeds (UK) where he was focusing on the development of soft continuum magnetic robots for surgical intervention (an EPSRC funded project). He also has developed the worlds first soft continuum microrobot used for angioplasty application in DGIST-ETH joint microrobotics research centre (Switzerland, S. Korea). In S. Korea he also collaborated with the GIST intelligence medical robotics laboratory (S. Korea) for developing magnetic-based mechatronics systems. His research interests revolve around Micro/nanotechnology and Robotics for health care and environmental applications.
