(downloadable) Selected Recent Talks GENERAL RESEARCH INTERESTS: THEORETICAL CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS My research interests are in the study of phases and phase transitions in strongly interacting quantum systems, including magnetism, metal-insulator transitions, and superconductivity. I am currently working on topological materials, disordered heavy fermions, the x-ray spectroscopy of lanthanides, charge density wave systems, and the model Hamiltonians which can be used to describe them. The group is also exploring machine learning algorithms related to these projects. The methodology I most commonly employ in these studies is Quantum Monte Carlo. I am interested in developing algorithms for doing these simulations more effectively. My research is supported by the Department of Energy and the NNSA. MURPPS UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH PROGRAM I am the chairman of the executive committee of a program which provides undergraduates the opportunity to work one-on-one with UC Davis faculty to do research.
