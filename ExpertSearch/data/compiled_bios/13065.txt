Chemical Engineering, MIT, Cambridge, MA B.S. Chemical Engineering (Hons), Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PAResearch InterestsEnvironmental aspects of water, energy, and sustainability.Environmental aspects of water, energy, and sustainability with a focus on nature-based solutions and ecosystem services provided by urban nature preserves and green infrastructure (GI) including water storage, flood mitigation, urban microclimate regulation, and air pollution mitigation. Data from a network of groundwater, surface water, and soil moisture sensors provides information on water storage and transport across Gensburg Markham Prairie (GMP a high- quality remnant prairie owned by The Nature Conservancy and Northeastern Illinois University) as a function of precipitation history, season, and time for use in predicting GMP water storage and release dynamics to understand the impact for mitigating flooding in surrounding neighborhoods. Microbial-fuel-cell-powered sensors to assess soil moisture and water levels in natural areas and green infrastructure. Research in collaboration with the Center for Neighborhood Technology in Chatham, the Chicago neighborhood with the most flood insurance claims in 2007-2011, focuses on the impacts of installing GI, such as rain gardens, in urban neighborhoods.
