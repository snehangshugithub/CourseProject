He was the Deputy Dean of CECS between 2015-18, the Director of the ResearchSchool of Engineering at ANU between 2010-14 and the Leader of the Wireless Signal Processing (WSP) Program at the National ICT Australia (NICTA) from November 2005 to June 2007. His research interests are in the areas of spatial audio and acoustic signal processing, and multi-channel signal processing. Thushara enjoys 'research training' and thinks he is a good mentor. He always try to improve and practice his emotional intellegence. He has supervised 39 PhD students and co-authored over 300 peer reviewed papers. Professor Abhayapala was an Associate Editor of IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing (2013-17) and he was a Member of the Audio and Acoustic Signal Processing Technical Committee (2011-2016) of the IEEE Signal Processing Society. He is a Fellow of the Engineers Australia (IEAust). Among many contributions, he is one of the first researchers to use spherical harmonic based eigen-decomposition in microphone arrays and to propose the concept of spherical microphone arrays; novel contributions on the multizone sound field reproduction problem; was one of the first to show the fundamental limits of spatial sound field reproduction using arrays of loudspeakers and spherical harmonics. Physically inspired signal processing problems in the areas of Acoustics and Spatial Audio; Wireless and Mobile Communications; and Bio-medical applications. These include spatial sound-field recording and reconstruction, broadband/ nearfield beamforming, array signal processing, photo-acoustics, wireless channel modelling, capacity analysis of spatial channels, wave propagation modelling, and MIMO systems.
