We aim to understand how post-translational modifications to these building-blocks, as well as the factors that regulate these events, play essential roles in maintaining the integrity of cells, tissues, and ultimately entire organisms. We implement a combination of functional genomics, biochemical, genetic, and epigenomic approaches to study how chromatin and epigenetic factors decode the chemical language of chromatin, and how these are dysregulated in diseases such as cancer. Yadira Soto-Feliciano will begin her appointment in early 2022.
