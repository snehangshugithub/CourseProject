I specialize in evolutionary biology problems that often intersect other biological areas, such as population genetics, epidemiology, and comparative genomics. A central methodological theme that cuts across all facets of my research is statistical inference for stochastic processes. I work with stochastic models that can describe complex dynamics of biological systems, but remain computationally tractable and interpretable from a scientific point of view. I have recently expanded my application domain by developing statistical methodology for stochastic processes that arise in medical statistics and in studies of infectious disease dynamics. Vladimir Minin is an Associate Professor of Statistics and Biology at the University of Washington, Seattle. He completed his Ph.D. in Biomathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he was advised by Marc Suchard. His dissertation included mathematical modeling and Bayesian analyses of viral evolution and won a Savage award for the best Bayesian dissertation in Applied Methodology by the International Society for Bayesian Analysis. He is interested in stochastic modeling, evolution, and epidemiology.
