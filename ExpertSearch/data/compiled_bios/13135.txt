Pryor is an atmospheric scientist who uses a combination of field measurements and numerical tools to improve understanding of the climate system. She completed her PhD at the University of East Anglia in the UK during which she spent time at Scripps Institute of Technology in San Diego and the Desert Research Institute in Reno, Nevada. She then took a position as a Post Doctoral Fellow at the University of British Columbia, Canada. She joins Cornell from Indiana University where she held the rank of Provost's Professor. Professor Pryor has courtesy appointments at Aarhus University in Denmark and the Pervasive Technology Institute at Indiana University.Research InterestsProf. Pryoris part of a new generation of scientists who are conducting research across traditional disciplinary boundaries and engaging in work to address societal grand challenges in climate science and energy science using a wide suite of big data analytics on experimental data collected by her group and also high-resolution, high-fidelity atmospheric simulations.Energy and the EnvironmentEarth and Atmospheric ScienceEarth System ScienceClimate and PaleoclimateMeteorology and Applied ClimatologyBiogeochemistry and Climate InteractionsEnergy, Mineral and Water ResourcesGeophysical Fluid DynamicsAtmospheric Science and ClimateTeaching InterestsProf. Pryor has taught across the spectrum of atmospheric science courses including air pollution meteorology, climate science and climate change mitigation, and physical meteorology and climatology.She currently teaches:EAS 2500Meteorological Observations and InstrumentsEAS 3340 MicroclimatologyEAS 4350/5350Statistical Methods in Meteorology and ClimatologySelected PublicationsPryor S.C., Barthelmie R.J. and Shepherd T.J.
