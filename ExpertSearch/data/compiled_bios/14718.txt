Suite 1300Office 1305Columbia, SC 29208 Background Ph.D., Management of Information Systems and Technology, Claremont Graduate UniversityM.B.A., Peter F. Drucker Graduate School of Management, Claremont Graduate UniversityB.A., Brigham Young University Dr. Schooley's research is focused on discovering how software systems can be conceptualized, designed, developed and applied to accomplish improvements in how people work, make decisions and interact with each other. This includes work in human computer interaction, user experience design, mobile computing, decision support, and a large-scale systems thinking approach to designing technology enabled improvements in healthcare. His work on mobile and web-based technologies for inter-organizational emergency medical services (EMS) has gained National attention and has been funded by the National Science Foundation and Federal Highway Administration. His work on designing and using IT to improve work and health outcomes for vulnerable populations has been funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, U.S. Department of Labor, The Duke Endowment, and the California Wellness Foundation. His work in user experience design and field testing extends across several domains and user populations including emergency response, inpatient and ambulatory healthcare settings, people with disabilities, aging individuals with musculosketal conditions, and others. He has published and presented his work in more than 75 scientific journals, National and International conference proceedings, and technical reports on these topics. He earned his M.B.A. from the Peter F. Drucker Graduate School of Management and his Ph.D. from the School of Information Systems and Technology both from Claremont Graduate University; and his B.A. from Brigham Young University.
