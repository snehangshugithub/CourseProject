Hardt Ralph E. and Eloise F Cross Professor of Mechanical Engineering Massachusetts Institute of Technology Room 35-231 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 617-253-2252 hardt@mit.edu Professor Hardt has been a member of the Mechanical Engineering faculty since 1979, and is a founding member of the Engineering Systems Division at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His disciplinary focus is system dynamics and control as applied to manufacturing. His teaches focuses on control, dynamics and manufacturing processes. His research has been on flexible automation, and process control, with an historical emphasis on welding and forming processes, and a current focus on polymer micro embossing. In welding, he pioneered the use of multivariable control techniques for modeling and control of GMAW, and demonstrated the use of adaptive control in these systems. In the forming processes, he has concentrated on the use of in-process measurements and real-time modeling to reduce sensitivity to machine and material variations, and has developed a flexible tooling and closed loop shape control concept for 3D sheet parts. The later has implemented in the aerospace industry with specific uses for repair part manufacture. His more recent work has been in the hot micro-embossing process for micro-fluidic device manufacture in micro-contact process scale-up using roll to roll processes. In both cases the theme of the work is novel equipment design and overall equipment and process statistical control. His current projects include methods for lower cost large scale metal additive manufacturing, and the use of polymer additive methods for the large-scale production of low-cost homes using recycled materials. Prof. Hardt has taught classes in both Mechanical Engineering and Manufacturing, and has led the creation of a professional graduate degree: Master of Engineering in Manufacturing at MIT. This is the first professional degree offered by the ME Department at MIT, and is the culmination of many years of course and curriculum development. Professor Hardt has supervised 27 PhD theses, 143 SM theses and 51 Master of Engineering Theses, and has served on the PhD committees of 45 students. Recently he led the development of a MicroMaster credential on the EdX platform in the Principles of Manufacturing and contributed 2 of the 8 modules that comprise one semester of the MIT MEng in Manufacturing degree. This program has had awarded more than 3400 certificates in the first three years of operation. Prof. Hardt served as Director of the MIT Laboratory for Manufacturing from 1985 - 1992 and as Engineering Co-Director for the MIT Leaders for Manufacturing Program from 1993 to 1998. As Co-Director of LFM, he has been a Co-Principle Investigator for the Next Generation Manufacturing Project. This project involved the participation of hundreds of manufacturing professionals, and combined the efforts of over 12 Industry associations to develop an industry view of the future of manufacturing enterprises. From 1999-2005, he was the MIT co-Chair of the Innovation in Manufacturing Systems and Technology Programme, part of the Singapore MIT Alliance (SMA), and following that as co-Chair of the SMA-2 programme Manufacturing Systems and Technology from 2006 2014. Prof. Hardt also served as Associate Department Head for Teaching and Graduate Officer in the Mechanical Engineering Department. He currently serves on the Technical Advisory Board of three companies: Digital Alloys, Industrial ML and MyTide Therapeutics.
