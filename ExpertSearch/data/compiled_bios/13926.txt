Gertler Professor of Biology Emeritus Before closing his lab, Frank B. Gertler considered the role of cell shape and movement in developmental defects and diseases. 617-253-5511 Phone 76-361 Office fgertler@mit.edu Email Ryan Hayman Assistant 617-253-0796 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1992, University of Wisconsin-Madison BS, 1985, Zoology, University of Wisconsin-Madison Research Summary Before closing his lab, Frank Gertler's research combined mouse genetics, cell biological and biochemical approaches to investigate the interplay between signal transduction pathways and the actin cytoskeleton. They deduced the functional importance of these regulatory systems in organismal development and disease. Their main focus was cell motility and the control of cellular protrusions specifically, motility during tumor cell invasion and metastasis, as well as how neurons migrate and extend their growth cones.
