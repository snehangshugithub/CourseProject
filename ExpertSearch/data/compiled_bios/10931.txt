His research is concerned with the dynamics of complex systems, for the most part in the geosciences. For over thirty years, his research has focused on using statistical physics to understand the physics of earthquakes and other driven threshold systems. Mathematically, these systems are characterized by phase transitions, both first (nucleation) and second order types. The dynamics of these systems can be understood by the use of field theories developed in other areas of physics, including particle physics and cosmology. Professor Rundle has a particular interest in the development of methods for earthquake forecasting based on studies of chaos and complexity in driven nonlinear systems, as well as on the use of realistic, large scale numerical simulations. More recently, he has developed an interest in viewing crashes in economic and financial systems as a kind of .Econoquake. that might be understood by analogy to earthquakes and other first order (nucleation) phase transitions. He is also Director of the California Institute for Hazard Research of the University of California, and Executive Director of the APEC Cooperation for Earthquake Simulation (ACES), a consortium of 6 APEC economies whose goal is to understand the entire earthquake cycle by means of rigorous models and numerical simulations. Major earthquakes have led to the deaths of approximately 1 million persons world-wide since 2000, including the 2010 Port-au-Prince Haiti, 2008 Wenchuan, China, and 2004 Sumatra disasters. As a result of economic forces, human societies will continue to move into at-risk regions, meaning that the risks to human populations will continue to increase with time. For that reason, the areas of earthquake and hazard forecasting, general hazard analysis, and risk management for the global public are critical for the sustainability of human populations.
