Mechanical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, 2008 Research Interests: Dr. Camburns work in design explores conceptual ideation, prototyping, and testing to support the embodiment of complex systems at low cost. Biography: Bradley Camburn received his Ph.D. from the University of Texas in 2015 and his Bachelors degree from Carnegie Mellon University in 2008, both are in Mechanical Engineering. He then joined former Citibank executive Adam Gilmour as Chief Engineer, then later Head of R&D at Gilmour Space Technologies. He led the Research and Development team at Gilmour to produce the worlds largest hydrogen peroxide oxidised hybrid rocket engine at 70kN of thrust. This engine is believed to have set a record for shortest orbital class engine development program duration and lowest cost threshold. Dr. Camburn completed the engine qualification at Gilmour through Series B venture Capital funding, to receive in total $13.7 million. Before joining MIME at Oregon State, he also worked as a Research Scientist at the Singapore University of Technology andDesign and Massachusetts Institute of Technology International Design Centre (IDC). He has been at Oregon State since 2019.
