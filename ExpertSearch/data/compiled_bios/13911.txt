Swanson Career Development Professor Rebecca Lamason investigates what happens when cellular functions are hijacked by unwanted interlopers: namely, the bacteria that engender diseases like spotted fever and meningitis. 617-258-6155 Phone 68-670A Office rlamason@mit.edu Email Lab Website Gina Lee Assistant 617-258-6473 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 2011, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine BS, 2002, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Millersville University Research Summary In the Lamason lab, we investigate how intracellular bacterial pathogens hijack host cell processes to promote infection. In particular, we study how Rickettsia parkeri and Listeria monocytogenes move through our tissues via a process called cell-to-cell spread. We utilize cellular, molecular, genetic, biochemical and biophysical approaches to elucidate the mechanisms of spread in order to reveal key aspects of pathogenesis and host cell biology.
