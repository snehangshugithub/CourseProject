He is actively developing image-based computational tools for easily transforming raw biomedical imaging data into simple but clinically/biologically relevant biomechanical parameters of soft tissue pathologies (e.g. elasticity) and blood flow characteristics (e.g. kinetic energy). His current and past work also involves close industrial collaborations with Siemens Healthcare, among others. Through these collaborations, Dr. Jiang has developed real-time prototype elastography software in clinical ultrasound scanners to analyze and improve characterization of breast lesions, which has been successfully verified through multi-center clinical trials. By leveraging his multidisciplinary experience on medical imaging, image/signal processing and biomechanics, Dr. Jiang is looking forward to further expanding collaborations and developing a research lab that focuses on developing tools for advanced image-based biomechanical analysis. Insight gained from these developments will hopefully provide both clinical and basic scientists information regarding the micromechanical environment of diseased lesions such as cancers and cardiovascular diseases during the course of imaging and subsequent therapeutic interventions.
