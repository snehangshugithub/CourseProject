Biography Research Publications Toggle Accordion Biography AboutProf. Krioukov is the Director of theDK-Labat theNetwork Science Instituteat Northeastern University. DK-Lab research deals mostly with theory and fundamentals of complex networks. Research topics of particular interest to the lab are latent network geometry, maximum-entropy random graph ensembles and random geometric graphs, causal sets, navigation in networks, and fundamentals of network dynamics. While research in the lab mainly focuses on theoretical aspects of network science, these theoretical results are often applied to real-world network data to gain new knowledge and insights about the data. Toggle Accordion Research Research OverviewBig data analytics and practical applications, mathematical physics of networks.DK-LabThe main focus of research at the DK-Lab is network theory. Research topics of particular interest to the lab are latent network geometry, maximum-entropy random graph ensembles, random geometric graphs, graph curvature, causal sets, navigation in networks, and fundamentals of network dynamics. While research in the lab deals mainly with theoretical aspects of network science, the obtained theoretical results are often applied to real-world network data in a variety of applications.
