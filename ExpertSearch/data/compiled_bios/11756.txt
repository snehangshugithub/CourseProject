My group works on three main areas: (1) Resilient network control; (2) Information systems and incentive design; (3) Optimal resource allocation in large-scale infrastructure systems. By focusing on important questions in the domains of highway transportation, electric power distribution, and urban water networks, we develop new theory and design tools for improving the performance of critical infrastructure systems in the face of disruptions, both stochastic and adversarial.Our agenda is to design network monitoring and control algorithms and economic incentive schemes that help infrastructure users and operators make optimal decisions in the presence of uncertainties. This agenda is supported by our approach to: (i) model the cyber-physical interactions in infrastructures and assess their vulnerabilities; (ii) develop tools to detect and respond to both local and network-level failures; and (iii) design incentive schemes that improve the aggregate levels of public good, while accounting for the dependencies and private information among strategic entities.Teaching Interests1.008 Engineering Solutions to Societal Challenges1.020 Engineering Sustainability: Analysis and Design1.024/224 Machine Learning for Sustainable Systems1.208 Resilient Networks1.013 Senior Civil and Environmental Engineering Design (systems core advisor)Awards and HonorsC3.ai Digital Transformation Institute Research Award, 2020MIT, Ole Madsen Mentoring Award for contributions to inspiring, mentoring & educating students, 2020MIT, Energy Initiative Research Award, 2020National Academy of Engineering, China-America Frontiers of Engineering Symposium, speaker, 2019MIT, Robert N.
