Before he joined Rensselaer in 2019 he was the LANSCE (Los Alamos Neutron Science Center) Professor of physics at Los Alamos National Laboratory and New Mexico State University. Prior to this, he was a postdoctoral fellow with the Department of physics at the University of California San Diego in the Shpyrko and worked at the Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation in Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe in Germany as a Research scientific assistant. He received his B.Sc. (2005) and M.Sc. (2007) in Technical and Applied Physics from the St. Petersburg State Polytechnic University Russia. Professor Fohtung is particularly interested in nanoscale structure, fluctuations and dynamics arising due to coupled and competing spin, orbital, charge and lattice degree of freedom. To interrogate such order parameters in a variety of condensed matter systems, ranging from electronic and magnetic phases to soft matter, Professor Fohtung develops novel synchrotron based coherent x-ray and neutron scattering techniques. Professor Fohtung is the recipient of numerous awards including the LANSCE Professorship and Rosen Fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Professor. Fohtung is also the recipient of multiple grants including the US Department of Defense, Airforce of Office of Scientific Research (DoD-AFOSR), the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and other LANL directed research and development program awards. Professor Fohtung is currently a visiting professor at Lund University, and a LINXS (Lund Institute of Advanced Neutron and X-ray Science) fellow in Lund Sweden.
