He is a social scientist whose research focuses on the impact of information & communication technologies (ICTs) on historically marginalized and underserved communities. His projects strongly emphasize community-based, participatory research with applied goals, but are also inspired by and draw from a broad range of critical social theory. Jason's current research falls within three interrelated research agendas. The first agenda, ICTs & Indigenous Communities, examines how Indigenous communities are using digital technologies to engage in environmental politics related to climate change and environmental politics. This work explores how digital technologies produce new opportunities for Indigenous communities to lead collective forms of environmental politics, while simultaneously reproducing epistemic and colonial hierarchies within those politics. A second agenda, Community Connectivity, explores how community networks can be designed to empower underserved communities. Community networks are sets of telecommunications infrastructure that are designed, implemented, and managed by communities, and they are often used to provide underserved communities with free or low-cost cellular or Internet access. Jason's primary interest is in understanding the long-term socio-cultural impact of these networks, and how digital services and training can be developed to make the networks more empowering. Finally, a third research agenda, Libraries & Community Empowerment, explores the roles that libraries play in supporting community development and empowerment. This research has examined the role that libraries play internationally in supporting sustainable development, and more recently has shifted to asking what role libraries in the US might play in improving information literacy and addressing the spread of problematic information (e.g., mis- and disinformation). Jason is particularly interested in understanding how information literacy can be re-developed with underserved communities to address the emotional and socio-cultural dimensions of misinformation. These projects occur in a wide range of locations, including Seattle, the Canadian Arctic, the Peruvian Amazon, and dozens of countries across sub-Saharan Africa. This work has been supported by organizations including the US National Science Foundation (NSF), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Institute for Museum and Library Studies (IMLS), Facebook, and more. Jason received his PhD from the UW Department of Geography in 2017.
