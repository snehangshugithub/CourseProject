Prior to initiating a study abroad program or a partnership agreement with an institution abroad, all college faculty may meet first with CAS International Programs Director, Eric Friginal -efriginal@gsu.edu.Eric will help you through the many considerations when collaborating with a university overseas. Below are relevant sample forms that can help you in your preparation to initiate a program: Sending Students Abroad Guidelines and Procedures for Spring Break Study Abroad Proposals 1. Overall program cost must be under $3,000 per student 2. Arts and Sciences faculty members who have not yet run a program may be eligible for $1,000 in site visit funding from the Study Abroad Office and up to $1,000 from the College. Site visits enable potential Program Directors to look into all logistics of the program including cost of living, local transportation, living accommodations, etc. To initiate the site visit process, please contact Eric Friginal. 3. The potential Program Director will need to submit a completed program proposal. This form can be obtained only by meeting with Eric Friginal or Stephen Murray, Office of International Initiatives (OII) Study Abroad Program Director. A completed program proposal will include the following two documents: a syllabus and credit-hour calculation worksheet (the proposed program must feature a minimum of 37.5 contact hours). Samples of both documents are available on this website under Faculty Resources. 4. There is typically $1,000 available in scholarship funding for GSU students. The College may offer additional support.
