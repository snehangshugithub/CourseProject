Hynes Daniel K. Ludwig Professor for Cancer Research; Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Richard O. Hynes investigates the network of proteins surrounding cells to understand its roles in the spread of cancer throughout the body. 617-253-6422 Phone 76-361 Office rohynes@mit.edu Email Lab Website Education PhD, 1971, MIT MA, 1970, Biochemistry, Cambridge University BA, 1966, Biochemistry, Cambridge University Research Summary We study the mechanisms underlying the spread of tumor cells throughout the body, known as metastasis. We are particularly interested in the role of the extracellular matrix a fibrillar meshwork of proteins that surrounds both normal and tumor cells, which plays many important roles in tumor progression. We also investigate changes in the metastatic cells themselves and in the contributions of normal cells, both in terms of metastasis and other bodily functions.
