Of particular interest are unconventional battery materials with compositions, structural featuresor boththat vary significantly from commercial electrode materials, for which there is not yet a strong understanding of ion and electron transport. Our work spans the solid state chemistry and battery communities, with an emphasis synthesis, battery testing, and especially atomic structure characterization. The group is also growing to bridge additional communities in which atomic structure understanding is critical to functionality, e.g. magnetic and electronic materials for memory storage and computing applications. news Lab renovations are in progress! Big equipment has arrived (gloveboxes, and furnaces and cycler, OH MY!) and the team is working on scheduling installations, ordering smaller items, and planning lab safety and maintenance practices. The Lab after new flooring, fresh paint, and some of the major equipment purchases! From August 2020. The Lab at the beginning of renovations in January 2020. for more updates, check out the group Twitter @ButalaLab University of Florida Twitter UF Resources UF News UF Calendar myUFL One.UF Directory Campus Weather Campus Map Student Tours Academic Calendar Events Website UF Website Listing Accessibility Text-Only Version Privacy Policy Regulations
