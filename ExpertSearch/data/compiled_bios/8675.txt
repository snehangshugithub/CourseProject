His research interests are in random vibration, stochastic calculus, numerical methods for solving stochastic problems, probabilistic models for microstructures, wind/earthquake engineering, climate models, and Monte Carlo simulation. He is the author of over 200 papers in referred journals, a co-author of a book on random vibration, and the author of three books on non-Gaussian processes, Stochastic Calculus, and Stochastic Systems. Professor Grigoriu's research and education efforts have been recognized by the 1993 IASSAR Research Prize, the 1998 SAE Distinguished Probabilistic Methods Education Award, the election to the Romanian Academy of Technical Sciences (2004), the 2002 Alfred Freudenthal Medal, Daniel M. Lazar '29 Excellence in Teaching Award (2003), Doctor Honoris Causa from the Technical University of Civil Engineering, Bucharest, Romania (2004), and the 2005 Norman Medal of ASCE. Professor Grigoriu is on the editorial board of the Probabilistic Engineering Mechanics, Structural Safety journals, International Journal of Reliability and Safety, and Structure and Infrastructure Engineering Journal, and he is a past Editor in Chief for the Journal of Engineering Mechanics.Research InterestsGrigoriu's research focuses on random vibration, stochastic calculus, stochastic differential equations, stochastic partial differential equations, numerical methods for solving stochastic problems, probabilistic models for microstructures, wind/earthquake engineering, and Monte Carlo simulation.Computational Solid MechanicsStructural EngineeringTeaching InterestsFocus on engineering applications starting from fundamental concepts of mechanics, probability theory, statistics, and mathematics.Service InterestsSenate and contributions to CEE school, for example, participation in committees for reappointing faculty, MS and PhD affiliates.Selected PublicationsGrigoriu, M. 2016."Do seismic intensity measures (IMs) measure up?."Probabilistic Engineering Mechanics46: 80-93.Grigoriu, Mircea Dan. 2016."Properties of material responses at different scales."Paper presented at WCCM Conference, Seoul, Korea, July (3rd Quarter/Summer).Emery, J M., M D.
