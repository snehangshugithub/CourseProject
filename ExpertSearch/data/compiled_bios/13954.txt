The laboratory of materials and manufacturing utilizes both computational methods and experimental analyses to investigate the manufacturing and materials correlations. Biography: Having earned his B.S. and M.S. in Materials Science and Engineering, in 2015 Dr. Ali Tabei received a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology. Afterward, he continued his academic research as a post-doctoral fellow for one year. Later, he served as a senior research engineer at the ATI Corporation, working on developing manufacturing routes and new high-temperature alloys. In his early research career, Dr. Tabei investigated the synthesis of nanomaterials and semiconductor processing methods. His most recent works link manufacturing and materials science via computational and experimental tools. He joined Oregon State University as an assistant professor in Fall 2018.
