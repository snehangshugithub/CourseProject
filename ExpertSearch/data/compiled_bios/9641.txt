Dr. Saikia completed her PhD at the University of Chicago, where she developed quantitative and high throughput biochemical assays to analyze RNA modification levels in biological systems. Her work was supported by a fellowship from the Burroughs-Wellcome Trust. Following her PhD, Dr. Saikia conducted postdoctoral research at Case Western Reserve University and Cornell University, where she studied non-coding RNAs, and their role in gene expression control. In her current research, Dr. Saikia is using single cell RNA sequencing technology to study human immune cell function, as well as human pancreatic beta cell pathology that can lead to diabetes. Dr. Saikia joined the Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering, Cornell, in July 2020. Dr. Saikia teaches courses in the field of Cellular and Molecular Engineering. Her primary pedagogical objectives are to help students understand the fundamental concepts of biomedical engineering and how they can be applied to improve bodily functions.
