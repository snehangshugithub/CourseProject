Such systems include multiple, heterogeneousentities (humans, robots, parts, machines, etc.), and occur at widely varying spatial and temporalscales from controlled micro-bio environments to assembly workstations, warehouses,and smart vehicles. The methods span many disciplines, but fundamentally involveappliedoptimization,machine learning, andstochastic modeling. In particular, principles from Bayesianinference, classification and regression analysis, computational topology, deep neural networks,multi-agent coordination, and reinforcement learning are adapted in novel ways to realize unprecedentedsystem-level performances.Consequently, my research falls into the following three topicsbased on a combination of the target systems and the employed methods: i)Digital manufacturing:Analyze historical data to identify the key drivers affecting various performance measures such as yield, on-time parts deliveries, process defects, and parts mating gaps; ii)Predictive and prescriptive analytics: Predict the responses of time-varying systemsto prescribe optimal resource utilization; and, iii)Autonomous robotics: Develop robust systems where the robots can collaborate with each other and/or humans in challenging environments.
