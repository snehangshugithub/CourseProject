But discovering millions of galaxies was the easy part. He analyzed the galaxies' shapes to reveal subtle distortions caused by the gravitational fields of foreground masses, an effect called weak gravitational lensing. He was the first to detect cosmic shear, or weak lensing by the large-scale structure of the universe. He was also the first to detect a cluster of galaxies through its gravitational effects alone, and the first to combine source redshift information with lensing to probe structure in three dimensions (tomography). Because most matter is dark, these observations constrain the density of dark matter in the universe. Professor Wittman's recent work focuses on clusters of galaxies that collide, revealing interactions between gas, galaxies, and dark matter. These collisions play out over hundreds of millions of years but we observe just a snapshot in our lifetimes. Wittman's group observes these systems with spectroscopy and gravitational lensing, and creates models of the entire process based on snapshots of different systems observed at different stages of the process. The goal of this modeling is to determine whether dark matter interacts nongravitationally, which is an important question for particle models of dark matter. Wittman is also developing novel methods of gravitational lensing to enable more precise lensing observations of these systems.
