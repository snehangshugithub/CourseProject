He earned a Ph.D. from the Decision, Risk and Operations department at Columbia Universitys Graduate School of Business. He spent eight years teaching at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. His research interests include performance analysis and optimization of human-operated processing networks, the theory of stochastic-process approximation, and the application of operations research and statistical tools to healthcare processes.Research InterestsItai's primary research interests lie in the performance analysis, the design, and the optimization of stochastic systems, primarily queueing (or service) networks. On the optimization and design front, he is concerned with capacity planning and with the design of processing networks robust to various uncertainties (such as the behavior of individual decision-makers). On the performance analysis front, he studies the robustness of simple tractable approximations. He has been more recently interested in healthcare which, with all its complexities and challenges, is particularly suitable for applying processing-network theory.Service InterestsItai is an Associate Editor in the area of stochastic modeling for both Management Science and Operations Research and he chairs the Special Interested Group (SIG) on Service Operations for the Manufacturing & Service Operations Management society of INFORMS. He has organized the Service SIG mini-conference in 2014 and co-chairs the 2017 Applied Probability Society conference.Health SystemsNetworksStatistics and Machine LearningOptimizationResearch Group MembersSelected PublicationsZhang, Dennis J., Itai Gurvich, Jan A.
