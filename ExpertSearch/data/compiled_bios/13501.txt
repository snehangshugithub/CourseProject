From 2015 to 2018 he was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) in the Netherlands. He returned to ANU as a Research Fellow in 2018. In addition to ANU and TU/e, he has spent time at the Energy Research Center of the Netherlands (ECN) and at the Interuniversity Microelectronics Center (IMEC) in Belgium. My research interests are mainly in the field of photovoltaics (solar cells), with a particular focus on crystalline silicon. Focuses include: Advanced characterisation and modelling of recombination processes in semiconductors Surface passivation and carrier-selective contacts Fabrication and characterisation of thin-film nanolayers for solar cell applications (especially by ALD and CVD techniques) Characterisation and modelling of semiconductor interfaces My publication and citation record is available at Google Scholar. I can offer undergraduate and postgraduate research projects in the areas above. Please contact me if interested.
