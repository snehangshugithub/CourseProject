Significant experience in patient care ranging from outpatient ambulatory care to the intensive care unit, now working full time in clinical informatics (implementing healthcare information systems) and clinical research informatics (developing methods to better phenotype patients using EMR databases). Research: My current research is focused on developing methods to improve patient phenotyping using EMR databases, in particular the use of temporal abstractions and time intervals to define and identify patient cohorts. My second focus is on developing better ways to interact with patients and individuals in between medical visits or healthy individuals, for example developing systems to monitor patients in palliative home care and studying the use of social networking sites for public health research and practice.
