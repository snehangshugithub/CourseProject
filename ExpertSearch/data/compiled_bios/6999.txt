Herring Susan W. Herring Susan W. Herring Adjunct Professor herring@u.washington.edu B529 HSB (206) 543-3203 Not accepting graduate students Fields of interest Behavior, Physiology Research Biography Related news Relevant publications My lab studies feeding in mammals and relates the biomechanics of normal function to growth processes of the skull and cranial muscles. We use physiological techniques such as electromyography, sonomicrography, and strain gage recording to understand the contraction patterns of the muscles and how they load the skeletal tissues. These observations are then followed up morphometrically and with histology. We are especially interested in the influence of mechanical loading on cell division and differentiation. Our current major project investigates what happens to the jaw bones afterparalysis of single muscles using Botox.
