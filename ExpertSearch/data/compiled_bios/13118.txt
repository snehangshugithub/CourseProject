Dr. Yang completed his M.S. and Ph.D. at the University of California, Irvine. He was also awarded a second Masters degree in Statistics from the University of California, Irvine. He completed his B.S. at the University of Science and Technology of China. Dr. Yangs research focuses on the design and evaluation of connected and autonomous vehicle implementations to improve vehicle mobility and energy efficiency for the rapid development of smart cities. His major research interests include modelling and managing the behaviours of connected and autonomous vehicles to mitigate road congestions, to reduce vehicle energy consumption and emissions, and to improve the performance of road transportation services. He is also working on investigating vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications to manage transportation systems from micro- to macro-level urban networks. In addition, he is interested in exploring new mobility services in the era of connected and autonomous vehicles. Dr. Yang believes that connected and autonomous vehicles will not only bring new mobility mode to the existing transportation system, but also reshape the entire society. It would be a key technology which can bring a huge resolution of human lives in the near future.
