Personal profile Research interestsProfile Dr Chenghong Gu is a Reader in smart energy systems with the University of Bath, where he was EPSRC Postdoctoral Fellow (EP/M000141/1, 2014-2017). His research designs novel models and tools for planning and operating smart energy systems, including electricity, natural gas, heating/cooling, and transportation toward net zero. Dr Gu attracted 1.3 million funding in total, out of which more than 615k as PI from EPSRC, British Council, National Grid, Northern Powergrid, and Shanghai Electric. He was a key researcher for two LCNF projects with WPD LV Templates and Sola Bristol. Dr Gu has more than 90 peer-reviewed journal papers, and won three paper prizes: CEPRI Prize, 2018; Outstanding PhD Paper Prize at the 7th EEM, 2010; and Outstanding CSEE Yearly Paper, Proceedings of the CSEE, 2009. He was a committee member of Ofgems Safety, Resilience and Reliability working group, and now serves as a member of IEEE Committee for power economics and market and IEEE Working Group on network charging. He co-chaires Supergen Energy Networks Hub - Markets and Regulation Working Group. Dr Gu is a Subject Editor for IET Smart Grid, editor for IEEE Access and Scientific Report. Research Dr Gus primary research is concerned with planning and operating resilient smart multi-vector energy systems of electricity, natural gas, heating/cooling and transportation towards zero emissions by 2050 under the dramatic climate change. His research is primarily focused on three areas: 1. Multi-vector energy systems: The centrepiece of his research is to develop novel data-driven and advanced optimisation models for multi-vector energy systems. His research is to develop new robust optimisation and machine learning facilitated models, algorithms and methods for multi-vector energy systems. They can help energy system operators to enhance security costly-efficiently, reduce energy bills for customers, and increase penetration of renewables and low-carbon technologies, promoting the move towards zero emissions. 2. Energy system resilience under climate change: He is developing data-driven methods to study UK transmission system resilience under extreme weather events. It will identify system strengths and weaknesses that can hardly be obtained using traditional model-based approaches, thus informing new system planning and operation practices for network operators, and standards and regulatory frameworks for Ofgem and BEIS. 3. Energy market design: This area is explored with Prof Li at CSPD. The research identifies the future roles of DSOs in future low carbon energy, and designs novel local energy/network markets to facilitate local balancing. This strand of research can inform the pathways of DSO transition, the architecture of future local markets, thus creating a vibrant level playing field for all parties who will reshape the UK energy landscape from now till 2050.
