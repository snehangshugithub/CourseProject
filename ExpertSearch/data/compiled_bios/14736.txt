He mainly focuses on developing theoretical and computational models of natural and engineering systems associated with the multiphysics and multiscale aspects. Dr. Nas research areas encompass micromechanics of porous media and granular physics, computational plasticity modeling for extreme environmental conditions, homogenization theory and inverse problem, dynamic wave propagation, material instabilities (strain localization, soil liquefaction, damage, fracture, phase transition and crystallization), and data-driven computational mechanics. The special geotechnical applications include the multiphase frozen soil, geological carbon sequestration, hydraulic fracture, and nuclear waste disposal. Education B.S., M.S.. (Seoul National University), Ph.D. (Columbia University) Biography SeonHong Na received his B.S. (2008) and M.S. (2010) in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Seoul National University, Korea; and Ph.D. in Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics from Columbia University (2018). After obtaining his Masters degree, he worked as an Assistant Manager in Engineering and Consulting Company (Kunhaw, South Korea) followed by as a Research Scientist in the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (KIOST). He is the recipient of the Mindlin Scholar Award (2018), Donju Lee03 Memorial Award (2017), Teaching Assistant Excellence Award (2018, 2017) from Columbia University, and the Student Competition Awards (2nd Place) in ASCE EMI student paper competition (2016).
