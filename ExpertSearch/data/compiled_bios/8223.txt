He joined the UT faculty in 2017. Prior to joining UT he worked at the C.S. Draper Laboratory and at the NASA Johnson Space Center for more than nine years, where he contributed to the successful design and flight of numerous autonomous space navigation systems. Zanetti's current research includes on-board image processing and optical navigation, estimation of non-Gaussian/non-linear systems, simultaneous localization and mapping, and autonomous spacecraft GN&C. Zanetti is a Fellow of the American Astronautical Society (AAS), an Associate Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics Astronautics (AIAA), and a Senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. He is the chair of the AIAA Astrodynamics Technical Committee and a former chair of the AAS Space-Flight Mechanics Technical Committee. His work contributed to a successful EFT-1 flight and the selection of the Orion EFT-1 GN&C flight-software as the recipient of the 2015 NASA software of the year award. He also received a NASA Technical Excellence Award (2012), several NASA Group achievement awards and two NASA On The Spot Awards.
