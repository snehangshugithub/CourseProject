M.A., Physics, Princeton University, USA, 1968. B.S., Mathematics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA, 1966. B.S., Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA, 1966. Research Interests I work in Probability theory applied to models usually originating in Statistical Physics such as Ising models, spin glasses and percolation. I'm also interested in connections between the Riemann Hypothesis and Statistical Mechanics. Selected Publications D.L. Stein and C.M. Newman, Spin Glasses and Complexity (Princeton Univ.
