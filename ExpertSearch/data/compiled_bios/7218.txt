Swanson Multidisciplinary Design Laboratory. In this role, she is responsible for setting the vision for the Design Lab and the senior capstone design experience, obtaining industry sponsorships for senior design projects, planning and teaching courses and furthering pedagogical innovations. She has over 30 years of industrial and research experience. Prof. Dannemann has directed applied research and development programs bridging her extensive knowledge of materials response to solve design challenges for engineering applications ranging from aircraft fuel lines, military and commercial vehicles, naval vessels to the space shuttle, gas turbines, and biomedical systems. Her materials expertise covers a broad range of materials: metals, ceramics, glasses, composites, porous metals and geologic materials. Dr. Dannemann is most recognized for her work on the interactive effects of microstructure and processing on materials performance in extreme environments. Prior to returning to Rensselaer in January 2017, Dr. Dannemann was a Principal Engineer in the Engineering Dynamics Department at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, TX for 20 years. Other industry experiences include: Staff Metallurgist at the General Electric Company R&D center, Lead Engineer at GE Power Systems and Research Engineer at Bethlehem Steel Homer Research Laboratories. She is the author of over 150 government/industrial reports, presentations and publications. Prof. Dannemann served as President of the Society for Experimental Mechanics in 2017-18. She is a Fellow of ASM International, and also served on the Board of Trustees for ASM International from 2014-17. Dr. Dannemann has taught graduate and undergraduate courses, served as a counseler for the Society of Women Engineers student chapter at Trinity University for 10 years, and helped to initiate the ASM Teachers Materials Camp in San Antonio in conjunction with the Alamo Chapter of ASM International, the ASM Foundation, the US Air Force, and St. Mary's University.
