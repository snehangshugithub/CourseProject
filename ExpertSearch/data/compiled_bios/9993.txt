Desoer Chair in Engineering. Her research interests include hybrid systems, distributed and decentralized optimization, and control theory, with an emphasis on applications, unmanned aerial vehicles, air traffic control and modeling of biological processes. She taught at Stanford University from 1998 to-2007 where she was a director of the Hybrid Systems Laboratory and held joint positions the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and the Department of Electrical Engineering. She was awarded a MacArthur Genius grant in 2006 and the IEEE Transportation Technologies Award in 2017 "for contributions to air transportation systems, focusing on collision avoidance protocol design and avionics safety verification" Education 1998, Ph.D., EECS, UC Berkeley 1993, M.Sc., Electrical Engineering, Imperial College, London 1992, B.A.Sc., Electrical Engineering, University of Waterloo Selected Publications D.
