Chemistry (Phi Beta Kappa), Dickinson College, Carlisle, PAResearch InterestsFundamental and applied nanoscience, nanomaterials, nanibiotechnology, nanomedicine, nanolithography Our research focuses on developing methods for controlling the architecture of molecules and materials on the 1-100 nm length scale, and utilizing such structures in the development of analytical tools that can be used in the areas of chemical and biological sensing, lithography, catalysis, and optics. Mirkin has pioneered the use of biomolecules as synthons in materials science and the development of nanoparticle-based biodiagnostics. Many of the concepts and materials developed within his laboratories are now the basis for commercial detection and lithography systems.Significant Recognition2018 Remsen Award2018 Ralph N.
