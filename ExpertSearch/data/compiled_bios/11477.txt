She is the Director of theLaboratory for Diagnostics and Global Healthcare Technologiesand a member of the Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology. Before coming to Boston, Dr. Klapperich was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in the lab of Dr. Carolyn Bertozzi, and was a Senior Research Scientist at Aclara Biosciences in Mountain View, CA. She earned her Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley; her M.S. in Engineering Sciences from Harvard University and her B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering from Northwestern University. Dr. Klapperichs research is focused on engineering medical devices for use in low resource settings and at the point of care. Current projects are focused on disposable microfluidic diagnostics that incorporate on-board sample preparation and on minimally instrumented devices to enable molecular testing. Her work includes diagnostics for CT-NG,HPV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Recently, Dr. Klapperich and colleagues founded a startup company, Jane Diagnostics, Inc., to commercialize these technologies.
