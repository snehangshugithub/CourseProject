Professor Kirda was previouslyawarded the inauguralSy and Laurie Sternberg Interdisciplinary Chaired Professorship. Previously he was on the faculty of the Networking and Security Department at Institute Eurecom in France, andcomputer science faculty at Technical University of Vienna.Professor Kirdas research focuses on security issues with the potential to affect a large number of people. He is the co-founder and co-director of the International Secure Systems Lab, a collaborative effort of European and U.S. researchers focused on Web security, malware and vulnerability analysis, intrusion detection, and other computer security issues. The lab is well known in industry and academia for developing tools such as Anubis, which analyzes malware; FIRE (FInding RoguE Networks), which determines whether an Internet service provider has been hacked; and Pixy, which conducts vulnerability assessments for web pages.EducationPhD, Technical University of Vienna, 2002 Toggle Accordion Research Research OverviewMalware analysis and detection; web security; social network security; reverse engineering; intrusion detectionSelected Research ProjectsFlanker: Automatically Detecting Lateral Movement in Organizations Using Heterogeneous Data and Graph Representation Learning Principal Investigator, National Science FoundationContinuum: Finding Space and Time Vulnerabilities in Java Programs Co-Principal Investigator, Defense Advanced Research Projects AgencyDarkDroid: Exposing the Dark Side of Android Marketplaces Principal Investigator, Defense Advanced Research Projects AgencyFirmalice: Modeling and Identifying Malice in Firmware Principal Investigator, Defense Advanced Research Projects AgencyCollaborative: Automated Reverse Engineering of Commodity Software Co-Principal Investigator, National Science FoundationResearch Centers and InstitutesInstitute of Information Assurance (IIA)Department Research Areas Computer Networks and Security Toggle Accordion Publications Selected PublicationsM.
