We seek candidates with diverse backgrounds in foundational and/or applied biomedical informatics research who are interested in working and teaching in a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary academic setting. The departmental vision is to use biomedical information to improve health through research, training, and the practice of informatics in healthcare and research operations. We are focusing our recruitment on further expanding our existing research, education and practice in Clinical Informatics including Fellowship training. We are seeking faculty with foundational and applied expertise relevant to this area. If you are interested in applying for or in finding out more information about specific searches, please contact us at bhihires@uw.edu and review the job description(s) below (and the link(s) to the full job postings). Also please explore this website further for information about our current events, people, educational programs, research programs, and service activities of our department. The University and the Department The Department currently has 31 core faculty and 56 extended faculty representing 30 schools and departments across the University of Washington, 7 companies, and 14 universities and research organizations in WWAMI (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, Idaho) and around the world. The University of Washington (UW) is ranked in the top five among public universities nationally to receive federal research and training funds, and UW has received more federal research funding than any other U.S. public university since 1972 (more information about UW research is available here). University of Washington is home to a number of top ranked programs including the School of Medicine (nationally known both for research and primary care), the School of Nursing, the School of Public Health, the School of Computer Science and Engineering, the Information School and the Departments of Linguistics and Biostatistics. The Department was ranked number 3 in the world for clinical informatics according to US News and World Report. We collaborate with regional academic and industry partners including Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle Childrens Hospital, Center for Infectious Disease Research, the Washington Department of Health, Microsoft, Intel and Caradigm. The Department has two Divisions with a shared mission of using biomedical information to improve health. The Division of Medical Education and Evaluation focuses on the science, implementation and evaluation of the transmission of biomedical information (knowledge) to the next generation of physicians and other health care providers. The Division of Biomedical and Health Informatics focuses on the foundational and applied science and the implementation of systems that use biomedical data, knowledge and information to improve health. In the Division of MEE, faculty focus on a) research around development, implementation, and evaluation of health sciences curricula, b) teaching leaders in medical education (through the MEE led Teaching Scholars Program and the Center for Leadership and Innovation in Medical Education), and c) a key operational/service role in the School of Medicine around curriculum and course development, implementation and evaluation. In the Division of BHI, faculty are engaged in a broad range of foundational and applied biomedical informatics research. BHI faculty are also responsible for the operation, evaluation and refinement of the Biomedical Informatics research training program (M.S., Ph.D., Postdoc), which has at steady state 65 full-time enrolled students and postdoctoral fellows. In collaboration with the Information School we offer two undergraduate biomedical informatics courses. In collaboration with the School of Nursing, an applied M.S. in Clinical Informatics and Patient Centered Technologies is offered which at steady state has ~55 enrolled students. In collaboration with Family Medicine and UW Medicines Information Technology Services we have an ACGME-accredited Clinical Informatics Fellowship program with 4 Fellows. BHI faculty play key operational and leadership roles in research and clinical computing at UW Medicine. Where appropriate, our faculty aims to translate our foundational and applied scholarship in MEE and BHI into practice at the University of Washington, with our partner institutions, within our medical school curriculum, and with UW operational and clinical research computing groups. The University of Washington itself is situated in the beautiful city of Seattle, a veritable mecca for those who enjoy the beautiful outdoors and the diverse offerings of a big city. We look forward to your application and welcome your interest.
