My formal training is in electrical engineering and applied mathematics. I find that some of the more interesting problems I have worked on have come from looking at the real world with a strongly quantitative toolset. Along the way, I have spent time at a hedge fund and consulted for private industry and the U.S. Government. Finally, at the moment I am the associate head for undergraduate studies in the department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering.

New model shows how to make smart homes more frugalA University of Illinois professor has developed a smart home model that uses dynamic, real-time energy pricing data to operate household appliances in a way that saves the most money. Machine learning helps spot gait problems in individuals with multiple sclerosisMonitoring the progression of multiple sclerosis-related gait issues can be challenging in adults over 50 years old, requiring a clinician to differentiate between problems related to MS and other age-related issues. To address this problem, researchers are integrating gait data and machine... Driver behavior influences traffic patterns as much as roadway design, study reportsUrban planners may soon have a new way to measure traffic congestion. By capturing the different routes by which vehicles can travel between locations, Illinois researchers have developed a new computer algorithm that helps quantify regions of congestion in urban areas and suggests ways around them. Illinois Mathematics Researchers Develop Algorithm for Traffic CongestionUrban commuters may be less likely to encounter automobile accidents if they are willing to increase trip time, researchers report. A new study from the University of Illinois introduces a tool that helps quantify the connection between traffic accidents and city road networks. The study,...
