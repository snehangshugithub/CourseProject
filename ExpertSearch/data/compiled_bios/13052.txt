Environmental Engineering and Science, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA B.S. Mechanical Engineering, with minor in History, cum laude, Washington University, St. Louis, MOResearch InterestsMy research focuses on water, sediments, and microbiota, with particular emphasis on the basic processes that control interfacial dynamics in aquatic systems and the coupling of physical transport processes with biological and biogeochemical processes.I seek to define critical structure-transport-transformation relationships in dynamic environments such as rivers and surface-attached microbial communities (biofilms).My work is highly collaborative and encompasses fluid mechanics, particle transport and morphodynamics, aquatic chemistry, and microbiology.Important applications include benthic microbial ecology, nutrient and carbon cycling, contaminant transport and water quality, ecosystem degradation and restoration, waterborne disease transmission, and control of biofilms in human infection and engineered water systems.Significant RecognitionFulbright Distinguished Chair Award (2013)Cole-Higgins Award for Excellence in Advising, Northwestern University (2012)Huber Research Prize, American Society of Civil Engineers (2008)Career Award, National Institutes of Health (NIAID K25) (2006)McCormick Faculty Excellence Award, Northwestern University (2006)Searle Junior Teaching Fellow, Northwestern University (2001-2002)Career Award, National Science Foundation (1999)Department of Defense Graduate Fellowship (1991-1994)Myers Fellowship (full scholarship), Washington University (1987-1991)Significant Professional ServiceLimnology and Oceanography Fluids and Environments, Associate Editor, 2010PresentWater Resources Research, Associate Editor, 19992009)International Journal of Sediment Research, Editorial Board (2003Present)Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Board of Directors, 2009PresentInternational Association for Sediment Water Science, Board of Directors, 2005Present, Vice President (2011 present)ASCE, Task Committee on Pathogens in Wet Weather Flows, 2008PresentNSF Hydrologic Synthesis Summer Institute, Director, June-August 2010Selected PublicationsLi, Xiaobao; Lu, Nanxi; Brady, Hannah R.; Packman, Aaron I., Biomineralization strongly modulates the formation of Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa dual-species biofilms, FEMS microbiology ecology 92(12).Teitelbaum, Yoni; Dallmann, Jonathan; Phillips, Colin B.; Packman, Aaron I.; Schumer, Rina; Sund, Nicole L.; Hansen, Scott K.; Arnon, Shai, Dynamics of Hyporheic Exchange Flux and Fine Particle Deposition Under Moving Bedforms, Water Resources Research 57(4).Li, Angang; Drummond, Jennifer D.; Bowen, Jennifer C.; Cory, Rose M.; Kaplan, Louis A.; Packman, Aaron I., Effect of Decreasing Biological Lability on Dissolved Organic Matter Dynamics in Streams, Water Resources Research 57(2).Li, Angang; Bernal, Susana; Kohler, Brady; Thomas, Steven A.; Mart, Eugnia; Packman, Aaron I., Residence Time in Hyporheic Bioactive Layers Explains Nitrate Uptake in Streams, Water Resources Research 57(2).Krause, Stefan; Baranov, Viktor; Nel, Holly A.; Drummond, Jennifer D.; Kukkola, Anna; Hoellein, Timothy; Sambrook Smith, Gregory H.; Lewandowski, Joerg; Bonnet, Berta; Packman, Aaron I.; Sadler, Jon; Inshyna, Valentyna; Allen, Steve; Allen, Deonie; Simon, Laurent; Mermillod-Blondin, Florian; Lynch, Iseult, Gathering at the top?

Every aspect of every course should be a learning opportunity.Transmitting factual information and analytical methodology is straightforward, but broader skills are often de-emphasized in conventional courses. I use assignments such as laboratory exercises, student-led discussions, group projects, and case studies to supplement conventional assessment tools such as examinations and homework assignments.
