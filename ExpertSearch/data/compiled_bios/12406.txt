Schwartz investigates communication across biological membranes, using structural, biochemical, and genetic tools. 617-452-3851 Phone 68-480 Office tus@mit.edu Email Lab Website Sarah Wylie Assistant 617-253-9395 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 2000, Free University of Berlin MS, 1996, Biochemistry, Free University of Berlin BS, 1993, Biochemistry, Free University of Berlin Research Summary Our primary goal is to understand how signals and molecules are transmitted between the nucleus and cytoplasm across the nuclear envelope. We work to decipher the mechanism and structure of the machinery that executes these cellular processes. Key PublicationsStructures of TorsinA and its disease-mutant complexed with an activator reveal the molecular basis for primary dystonia.
