He joined the EECS faculty in 2000. Between 2000 and 2005, he was an assistant professor. Between 2005 and 2011, he was an associate professor. Between 2011 and 2020, he was a professor. In 2020, Dr. Subramanian moved to Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. He currently maintains an adjunct appointment at Berkeley while he graduates his remaining PhD students.Dr. Subramanian has authored or co-authored more than 200 research publications and patents. He has received numerous awards for his work, including an NSF CAREER Award, the IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Award, and the IEEE Paul Rappaport Award. He received the EE Department Outstanding Teaching Award in 2006.
