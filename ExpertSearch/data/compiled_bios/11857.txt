Her research is centered around developing brain-machine interfaces and understanding auditory and visual attention in humans using non-invasive techniques such as electroencephalogram (EEG). She is committed to better integrating data fluency and computational thinking into science and engineering education. Prior to joining Olin, Dr. Michalka was a postdoctoral fellow in the Center for Computational Neuroscience and Neural Technology at Boston University. She earned her undergraduate degrees in mechanical engineering and psychological science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and her doctorate in Computational Neuroscience at Boston University. Outside of academia, Dr. Michalka worked as an engineer for General Electric and served as Executive Director of Machine Science, a small education outreach non-profit.
