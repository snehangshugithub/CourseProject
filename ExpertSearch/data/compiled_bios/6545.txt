Currently, she is a Research Scientist at NVIDIA Research working in the Autonomous Vehicle Research Group. She obtained her M.S. and Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Stanford University where she was a member of the Stanford Autonomous Systems Lab, directed by Marco Pavone. Broadly speaking, her research focuses on using formal methods and verification techniques for safe interaction-aware planning and control for human-robot interactions. Education Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Astronautics, Stanford University M.S. in Aeronautics and Astronautics, Stanford University B.Eng. in Aeronautical (Space) Engineering, University of Sydney B.S. in Mathematics (Advanced), University of Sydney Research Statement Karen's research harnesses advances in learning-empowered robot autonomy and unites them with the rigor and assurances provided by formal methods to develop powerful yet safe and trustworthy autonomous systems. She previously worked on safe interaction-aware planning and control for autonomous vehicles, and leveraging formal methods for logical reasoning in robot learning. Her research draws upon techniques from control theory, robot motion planning, optimization, formal methods and verification, and machine learning.
