Background: B.S. Biochemistry (NCSU); B.S. Applied Mathematics (NCSU); Ph.D. Biomedical Informatics (Stanford University). Dr. Abernethys training included molecular evolution, knowledge representation for bioinformatics, network analysis, epidemiology of infectious disease, and interactive data visualization. Research: Models of infectious disease (including TB, HIV, and influenza), molecular epidemiology, network analysis, disease surveillance, data information, systems biology, data standards and integration, with a focus on infectious diseases and global health. Other: High-throughput biology/-Omics, evolutionary processes, bibliometrics, immunology and user interfaces. Representative publications: N. F.
