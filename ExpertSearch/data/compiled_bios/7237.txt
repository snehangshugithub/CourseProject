StevenGardWebsiteNorthwestern University Prosthetics-Orthotics CenterDepartmentsBiomedical EngineeringResearch InterestsWe are investigating human movement, particularly in areas of rehabilitation. Many of our projects focus on the biomechanics of able-bodied and pathological gait. Our goal is to better understand normal gait, and to use that knowledge to evaluate and improve the gait of persons who walk with prosthetic or orthotic devices. Results from our work may enable us to develop more functional lower-extremity prosthetic and orthotic components.Selected PublicationsNepomuceno A, Major MJ, Stine R, Gard S (2017).
