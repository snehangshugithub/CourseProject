Applications include tribology (lubrication, adhesion), interfacial compatibilization, electronics, ultrahigh density mass storage, and fuel cells. Overneys group is known for its pioneering efforts in developing novel scanning probe methods towards mapping inter- and intra-molecular energetics and transitions in thin film and self-assembled systems.Nanoscale Surface Science and Polymer RheologyDevelopments of technology are becoming more and more challenging because we are approaching the inherent limitations in materials. Within the scientific community, there is considerable effort being directed towards understanding the physical and chemical properties of interfaces and surfaces of thin films. In particular, on the submicrometer scale within the field of polymers and tribology (friction, wear, and adhesion), it has been recognized that surface mechanical and rheological properties, surface structures, and interfacial interactions are of great importance to improve reaction rates, energy efficiencies (e.g., fuel efficiency), etc. One of today's most promising techniques in studying surfaces on the submicrometer scale is the scanning probe microscope (SPM). The SPM derives from the scanning tunneling microscope (STM), the first real-space imaging tool with the capability of atomic-scale resolution. From the STM, a huge variety of other SPMs originated-such as the scanning force microscope (SFM) and the scanning near field optical microscope (SNOM).
