A.A.: Fullerton College 1999Research InterestsProf. Farhas research seeks to solve exciting problems in chemistry and materials science ranging from energy and environment related applications to challenges in national defense by employing atomically precise functional materials. By exploiting the modular nature of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) and porous organic polymers (POPs), we work to fundamentally understand the role of three-dimensional architecture in modifying a materials function for applications in gas storage and separation, catalysis, water remediation and detoxification of chemical warfare agent simulants.Selected PublicationsBottom-up construction of a superstructure in a porous uranium-organic crystalP.
