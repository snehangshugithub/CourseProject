D., Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, MA, USA) Sc., Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, MA, USA) Diplme dIngnieure, Ecole Polytechnique (Palaiseau, France) Sc., Ecole Polytechnique (Palaiseau, France)BiographyDr. Akonos laboratory investigates fracture events in complex materials using fundamentals of nanotechnology, materials science, and theoretical and applied mechanics. There are three focus areas: geological materials, high-performance structural materials, and biomaterials. For geological materials, the Akono research laboratory investigates the sustainability and viability of unconventional resource extraction as well as carbon dioxide geological storage. For structural materials, Dr. Akono studies novel low-carbon-footprint cement alternatives. For biomaterials, the focus is on creating novel scaffolds for bone tissue regenerative engineering.Research InterestsDr. Akonos laboratory investigates fracture and failure mechanisms in complex materials systems from the molecular level up to the macroscopic scale. This research is articulated over three main thrusts: environment-friendly and high-performance structural materials, natural and nano-engineeredbiomaterials, and geological materials such as shale or rock. Dr. Akonos areas of expertise include nano-mechanics, fracture analysis, nanotechnology, advanced experimental testing, and multiscale modeling.Significant RecognitionNIH Diversity Grant (2020)NIH Building Up Scholar (2020)Royal Society International Exchange Scheme Award (2019)Royal Society Speaker Invitation (2019)Northwestern University Searle Faculty Fellowship (2019)NSF GOALI (2019)ASCE New Faces of Civil Engineering Professionals (2016)National Center for Supercomputing Application Faculty Fellowship (2016)Significant Professional ServiceAssociate Member, American Society of Civil Engineers; Sub-societies: Engineers Without Borders and Engineering Mechanics InstituteMember, American Physical SocietyMember, Materials Research SocietyCommittee Member, American Society of Civil Engineers Rock Mechanics CommitteeCommittee Member, ASCE Engineering Mechanics Institute: Modeling Inelasticity & Multiscale Behavior Committee, Nano-mechanics CommitteeReviewer, Journal of Nano-mechanics and Micro-mechanics, Journal of Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering, Engineering and Fracture Mechanics, Surface and Coatings Technology, International Journal of Solids and Structures, Society of Petroleum Engineering, Mechanics Research Communications, Mechanics of Materials, International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences, International Journal of Damage Mechanics, Wear of MaterialsSelected PublicationsAkono, Ange-Therese; Zhan, Mimi; Chen, Jiaxin; Shah, Surendra P, Nanostructure of calcium-silicate-hydrates in fine recycled aggregate concrete, Cement and Concrete Composites 115.Nana, Achile; Kamseu, Elie; Akono, Ange-Therese; Ngoun, Jean; Djobo, Yankwa; Tchakout, Herv Kouamo; Bognozzi, Maria Chiara; Leonelli, Cristina, Particles size and distribution on the improvement of the mechanical performance of high strength solid solution based inorganic polymer composites, Materials Chemistry and Physics 267.Han, Lin; Pathirage, Madura; Akono, Ange Therese; Cusatis, Gianluca, Lattice Discrete Particle Modeling of Size Effect in Slab Scratch Tests, Journal of Applied Mechanics, Transactions ASME 88(2).Akono, Ange-Therese; Werth, Charles J.; Shi, Zhuofan; Jessen, Kristian; Tsotsis, Theodore T., Advanced Geomechanical Model to Predict the Impact of CO2-Induced Microstructural Alterations on the Cohesive-Frictional Behavior of Mt.
