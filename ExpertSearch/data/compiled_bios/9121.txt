Dr. Jiang's research leverages signal processing methods and artificial intelligence algorithms for biological signals, such as Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG), for neurorehabilitation engineering applications. In particular, his research focuses on new human-machine interfacing (HMI) technologies, including brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and muscle-man-interfaces (MMI). His innovations have resulted in new, more effective upper limb prosthetic control technologies and accelerated rehabilitation of motor functions for patients suffering from disorders, such as stroke. His research has also been applied more broadly to HMI for applications in kinesiology, neural plasticity (cortical and peripheral), ergonomics, and other related areas. These contributions have not only advanced the scientific knowledge of the field but have also achieved direct impacts on the biomedical industry as described below. To date, Dr. Jiang has authored and co-authored 84 refereed journal papers and 83 conference papers (full-length papers and extended abstracts), primarily within the top-most venues for the biomedical engineering, neurorehabilitation, neurophysiology, signal processing, machine intelligence, and related disciplines. Nearly half of his journal papers were published in EMBS transactions and journals. That these contributions are achieving impact is clear from how often they have been cited (Web of Science: 2681, H-index: 23, Google: 4579, H-index 30), and that Dr. Jiang has been invited to present his work at 11 different international conferences, as plenary speaker, workshop speaker, etc. Since he started his independent academic career in 2015, Dr. Jiang secured over $2 million (CAD) direction research fund in peer-reviewed competitions to support his program (as PI and co-PI). This includes the NSERC Discovery Accelerator Supplement, awarded to only 4% of thousands of applicants in the annual competition. This is a rare feat for a first-time applicant. Dr. Jiang was also awarded the highly competitive 2018 Early Researcher Award by the Province of Ontario Ministry of Research, Innovation, and Science, and most recently, Dr. Jiang was awarded the COVID-19 Alliance grant from NSERC in 2020. Dr. Jiang has supervised and co-supervised four post-doctoral fellows, six Ph.D., 21 Master, and 14 undergraduate students. Five Ph.D. students under his day-to-day supervision have successfully defended their Ph.D. degrees. The vast majority of these 40+ early-stage researchers have moved on to research positions in academia, government, or the private sector. Dr. Jiangs service to the scientific and engineering community has been extensive, including as an Associate Editor for the IEEE Journal in Biomedical and Health Informatics, Frontiers in Neuroscience, and the Brain-Computer Interfaces. He also Co-Chaired the Neurorehabilitation and Prosthetics Symposium at the IEEE International Neural Engineering Conference (2017), was Track Chair of the Myoelectric Control Symposium (2017), was Associate Editor for the IEEE International Conference of Robotics and Automation (2016), and will Co-Chair the upcoming workshop on BCI in aging research at the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (2018). He was elevated to Senior Member of IEEE/EMBS in 2014.Research InterestsBiological signal processingHuman-machine interfaces (HMI)Biomedical EngineeringNeurophysiologyNeurorehabilitationBrain-Computer Interface (BCI)Brain-Machine Interface (BMI)Electromyography (EMG)Electroencephalogram (EEG)Electrocardiogram (ECG)functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)Cognitive StresseHealthmHealthMedical RoboticsEducation2009, Doctorate, Biomedical Engineering, University of New Brunswick2004, Master of Applied Science, Biomedical Engineering, University of New Brunswick1998, Bachelor of Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong UniversityCourses*BME 202 - SeminarTaught in 2016BME 252 - Linear Signals and SystemsTaught in 2016SYDE 252 - Linear Systems & SignalsTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020SYDE 292 - Circuits,Instrument'n & MeasurTaught in 2020SYDE 544 - Biomed Measure Signal ProcessTaught in 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021SYDE 780 - Topics in Engineering SciencesTaught in 2016, 2017* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsJiang, Ning and Wang, Jing and Liu, Ding and Xue, Chenpeng and Qiu, Kun, Secure WDM-PON based on chaos synchronization and subcarrier modulation multiplexing, JOSA B, 33(4), 2016, 637 - 642Mrachacz-Kersting, Natalie and Jiang, Ning and Stevenson, Andrew James Thomas and Niazi, Imran Khan and Kostic, Vladimir and Pavlovic, Aleksandra and Radovanovic, Sasa and Djuric-Jovicic, Milica and Agosta, Federica and Dremstrup, Kim and others, Efficient neuroplasticity induction in chronic stroke patients by an associative brain-computer interface, Journal of neurophysiology, 115(3), 2016, 1410 - 1421Liu, Jianwei and Sheng, Xinjun and Zhang, Dingguo and Jiang, Ning and Zhu, Xiangyang, Towards Zero Retraining for Myoelectric Control Based on Common Model Component Analysis, IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 24(4), 2016, 444 - 454Xu, Ren and Jiang, Ning and Dosen, Strahinja and Lin, Chuang and Mrachacz-Kersting, Natalie and Dremstrup, Kim and Farina, Dario, Endogenous Sensory Discrimination and Selection by a Fast Brain Switch for a High Transfer Rate Brain-Computer Interface, , 2016Hahne, Janne M and Farina, Dario and Jiang, Ning and Liebetanz, David, A Novel Percutaneous Electrode Implant for Improving Robustness in Advanced Myoelectric Control, Frontiers in neuroscience, 10, 2016In the NewsTwo professors named to Canada Research ChairsGaming technology startup secures $350k in backingGraduate StudiesCurrently considering applications from graduate students.
