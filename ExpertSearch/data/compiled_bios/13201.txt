This alloy was chosen as the sheath material for ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor). Research Research Interests Environmental effects on materials behavior Electrochemistry Corrosion Advanced materials for fusion systems advanced statistical and experimental techniques for experimental analysis Nuclear fuel performance analysis Research profile Understanding and predicting materials behavior: NSE takes an interdisciplinary approach Patents US Patent Number 4785142, issued 11/15/88 European Patent Number 0285952, issued 3/1/92 Title: "Superconductor Cable" Patent Holders: R.G. Ballinger, D.F. Smith (INCO Alloys, Inc.), B.L. Lake (INCO Alloys, Inc.) Patent is for a new high strength, Low Coefficient Expansion (COE) alloy for use as a structural material for Nb3Sn superconducting cables. The use of this new alloy will allow higher current carrying capability by the superconductor and, thus, higher fields and/or smaller hardware. The new alloy also has use in high temperature gas turbine engine applications. Publications Papers in Refereed Journals Y. Watanabe, R. Ballinger, O.K. Harling, G.E.
