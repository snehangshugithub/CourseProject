Stiven, Alan E. May 30, 2019 Stiven, Alan E. Professor (Emeritus) alan_stiven[at]unc.edu 429 Wilson Hall At a Glance Ecological genetics of intertidal mussels Population biology and regulation of terrestrial gastropods Impact of highways on selected fauna (with Chris Brooks, graduate student) Importance of small-scale movements in stream fish (with Brad Lamphere, graduate student) Synopsis My research interests encompass population and community phenomena in a variety of aquatic and terrestrial environments. My work with mollusks deals with genetic and ecological aspects of population regulation processes. Estuarine investigations are focused on predation, control of benthic communities, and on mechanisms structuring the genetic and ecological properties of intertidal bivalve populations.
