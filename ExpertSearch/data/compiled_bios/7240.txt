Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College London, UK Ecole Polytechnique Diploma, FranceResearch InterestsVictor Lefvre is interested in highly-deformable heterogeneous materials and the wide range of mechanical and physical properties they exhibit. His research focuses on the development of analytical and computational tools aimed at describing and predicting the macroscopic multi-physics behavior of these materials from their microscopic characteristics. Thanks to their capability to undergo very large deformations in response to a wide range of external stimuli (including, for instance, mechanical, electric, magnetic, or chemical stimuli), these soft smart materials hold tremendous potential for practical uses in new high-end technologies in significant fields such as robotics and medicine.Significant RecognitionHaythornthwaite Research Initiation Award, ASME AMD, 2018Hibbitt Engineering Postdoctoral Fellowship, School of Engineering, Brown University, 2017Selected PublicationsLefvre, Victor; Danas, Kostas; Lopez-Pamies, Oscar, Two families of explicit models constructed from a homogenization solution for the magnetoelastic response of MREs containing iron and ferrofluid particles, International Journal of Non-Linear Mechanics 119.Lefevre, Victor; Garnica, Alvaro; Lopez-Pamies, Oscar, A WENO finite-difference scheme for a new class of HamiltonJacobi equations in nonlinear solid mechanics, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 349:17-44.Shrimali, Bhavesh; Lefvre, Victor; Lopez-Pamies, Oscar, A simple explicit homogenization solution for the macroscopic elastic response of isotropic porous elastomers, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 122:364-380.Kothari, Mrityunjay; Cha, Moon Hyun; Lefevre, Victor; Kim, Kyung Suk, Critical curvature localization in graphene.
