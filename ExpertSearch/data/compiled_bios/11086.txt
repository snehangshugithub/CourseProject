Physical review letters Kovachy, T., Hogan, J. M., Sugarbaker, A., Dickerson, S. M., Donnelly, C. A., Overstreet, C., Kasevich, M. A. 2015; 114 (14): 143004-? Abstract Using a matter wave lens and a long time of flight, we cool an ensemble of ^{87}Rb atoms in two dimensions to an effective temperature of less than 50_{-30}^{+50}pK. A short pulse of red-detuned light generates an optical dipole force that collimates the ensemble. We also report a three-dimensional magnetic lens that substantially reduces the chemical potential of evaporatively cooled ensembles with a high atom number. By observing such low temperatures, we set limits on proposed modifications to quantum mechanics in the macroscopic regime. These cooling techniques yield bright, collimated sources for precision atom interferometry.

M., Kasevich, M. A. 2013; 111 (11) Abstract We present a method for determining the phase and contrast of a single shot of an atom interferometer. The application of a phase shear across the atom ensemble yields a spatially varying fringe pattern at each output port, which can be imaged directly. This method is broadly relevant to atom-interferometric precision measurement, as we demonstrate in a 10m ^{87}Rb atomic fountain by implementing an atom-interferometric gyrocompass with 10mdeg precision.

Physical review letters Dickerson, S. M., Hogan, J. M., Sugarbaker, A., Johnson, D. M., Kasevich, M. A. 2013; 111 (8): 083001-? Abstract We show that light-pulse atom interferometry with atomic point sources and spatially resolved detection enables multiaxis (two rotation, one acceleration) precision inertial sensing at long interrogation times. Using this method, we demonstrate a light-pulse atom interferometer for ^{87}Rb with 1.4cm peak wave packet separation and a duration of 2T=2.3s. The inferred acceleration sensitivity of each shot is 6.710^{-12}g, which improves on previous limits by more than 2 orders of magnitude. We also measure Earth's rotation rate with a precision of 200nrad/s. View details for PubMedID 24010433 New method for gravitational wave detection with atomic sensors. Physical review letters Graham, P. W., Hogan, J. M., Kasevich, M. A., Rajendran, S. 2013; 110 (17): 171102-? Abstract Laser frequency noise is a dominant noise background for the detection of gravitational waves using long-baseline optical interferometry. Amelioration of this noise requires near simultaneous strain measurements on more than one interferometer baseline, necessitating, for example, more than two satellites for a space-based detector or two interferometer arms for a ground-based detector. We describe a new detection strategy based on recent advances in optical atomic clocks and atom interferometry which can operate at long baselines and which is immune to laser frequency noise. Laser frequency noise is suppressed because the signal arises strictly from the light propagation time between two ensembles of atoms. This new class of sensor allows sensitive gravitational wave detection with only a single baseline. This approach also has practical applications in, for example, the development of ultrasensitive gravimeters and gravity gradiometers.

M., Kasevich, M. A. 2012; 37 (18): 3861-3863 Abstract We demonstrate high-efficiency frequency doubling of the combined output of two 1560 nm 30 W fiber amplifiers via single pass through periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) crystals. The temporal profile of the 780 nm output is controlled by adjusting the relative phase between the seeds of the amplifiers. We obtain a peak power of 34 W of 780 nm light by passing the combined output through one PPLN crystal, and a peak power of 43 W by passing through two cascading PPLN crystals. This source provides high optical power, excellent beam quality and spectral purity, and agile frequency and amplitude control in a simple and compact setup, which is ideal for applications such as atom optics using Rb atoms.

M., Johnson, D. M., Kovachy, T., Sugarbaker, A., Chiow, S., Kasevich, M. A. 2012; 83 (6) Abstract We have demonstrated a 100-fold improvement in the magnetic field uniformity on the axis of a large aspect ratio, cylindrical, mumetal magnetic shield by reducing discontinuities in the material of the shield through the welding and re-annealing of a segmented shield. The three-layer shield reduces Earth's magnetic field along an 8 m region to 420 G (rms) in the axial direction, and 460 and 730 G (rms) in the two transverse directions. Each cylindrical shield is a continuous welded tube which has been annealed after manufacture and degaussed in the apparatus. We present both experiments and finite element analysis that show the importance of uniform shield material for large aspect ratio shields, favoring a welded design over a segmented design. In addition, we present finite element results demonstrating the smoothing of spatial variations in the applied magnetic field by cylindrical magnetic shields. Such homogenization is a potentially useful feature for precision atom interferometric measurements.

M., Hammer, J., Chiow, S., Dickerson, S., Johnson, D. M., Kovachy, T., Sugarbaker, A., Kasevich, M. A. 2011; 36 (9): 1698-1700 Abstract We built an ultra-low-noise angle sensor by combining a folded optical lever and a Sagnac interferometer. The instrument has a measured noise floor of 1.3 prad/Hz at 2.4 kHz. We achieve this record angle sensitivity using a proof-of-concept apparatus with a conservative N=11 bounces in the optical lever. This technique could be extended to reach subpicoradian/Hz sensitivities with an optimized design.

M., Hogan, J. M., Chiow, S., Kasevich, M. A. 2010; 35 (5): 745-747 Abstract We demonstrate serrodyne frequency shifting of light from 200 MHz to 1.2 GHz with an efficiency of better than 60%. The frequency shift is imparted by an electro-optic phase modulator driven by a high-frequency high-fidelity sawtooth waveform that is passively generated by a commercially available nonlinear transmission line. We also implement a push-pull configuration using two serrodyne-driven phase modulators, allowing for continuous tuning between -1.6 GHz and +1.6 GHz. Compared with competing technologies, this technique is simple and robust, and it offers the largest available tuning range in this frequency band.

A., Hogan, J., Kasevich, M. 2008; 100 (12) Abstract We propose an atom-interferometry experiment based on the scalar Aharonov-Bohm effect which detects an atom charge at the 10{-28}e level, and improves the current laboratory limits by 8 orders of magnitude. This setup independently probes neutron charges down to 10{-28}e, 7 orders of magnitude below current bounds.

W., Hogan, J. M., Kasevich, M. A. 2007; 98 (11) Abstract The unprecedented precision of atom interferometry will soon lead to laboratory tests of general relativity to levels that will rival or exceed those reached by astrophysical observations. We propose such an experiment that will initially test the equivalence principle to 1 part in 10(15) (300 times better than the current limit), and 1 part in 10(17) in the future. It will also probe general relativistic effects - such as the nonlinear three-graviton coupling, the gravity of an atom's kinetic energy, and the falling of light - to several decimals. In contrast with astrophysical observations, laboratory tests can isolate these effects via their different functional dependence on experimental variables.
