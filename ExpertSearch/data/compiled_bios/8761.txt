BioDr. Lermusiaux is Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Ocean Science and Engineering at MIT. He received a Fulbright Foundation Fellowship (1992), the Wallace Prize at Harvard (1993), the Ogilvie Young Investigator Lecture in Ocean Eng. at MIT (1998), and the MIT Doherty Chair in Ocean Utilization (2009-2011). In 2010, the School of Eng. at MIT awarded him with the Ruth and Joel Spira Award for Distinguished Teaching. He has made outstanding contributions in data assimilation, as well as in ocean modeling and uncertainty predictions. His research thrusts include understanding and modeling complex physical and interdisciplinary oceanic dynamics and processes. With his group, he creates, develops and utilizes new mathematical models and computational methods for ocean predictions and dynamical diagnostics, for optimization and control of autonomous ocean systems, for uncertainty quantification and prediction, and for data assimilation and data-model comparisons. He has participated in many national and international sea exercises. He has served on numerous committees and organized large meetings and workshops. He is associate editor in three journals. He has more than hundred twenty refereed publications.
