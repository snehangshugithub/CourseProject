Biological EngineeringDownload CVEducationPh.D. Physics, Cambridge University, Cambridge, England B.A. Physics, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Mexico City, MexicoResearch InterestsResearch in the Olvera de la Cruz group is centered around the development of models to describe the self-assembly of heterogeneous molecules including amphiphiles, copolymers, and synthetic and biological polyelectrolytes, as well as the segregation and interface adsorption in multicomponent complex fluids. Work by the group has resulted in a revised model of ionic-driven assembly:demonstrating the electrostatic spontaneous symmetry breaking of ionic fibers and membranes, and identifying itsrelevance to biological functions and to the design of functional materials. The group's investigations into soft and condensed matter physics have advanced scientific knowledge and opened new research fields of technological importance, including gel electrophoreses dynamics, self-organization of molecular electrolytes into bio-mimetic materials, self-assembly of heterogeneous molecules into complex nanostructures, interface adsorption and phase segregation dynamics and structure of multicomponent fluids.Significant RecognitionMember of the American Philosophical Society, 2020National Institutes of Health FIRST Award, 198893David and Lucille Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering, 198994Alfred P.
