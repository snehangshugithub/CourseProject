He received the Ph.D. degree from University of Surrey, Guildford, UK in 2011. Upon completion of the PhD, he held a postdoctoral research assistant position at Brunel University and worked on an EPSRC funded project on application of compressive sensing for terahertz imaging. Then, he joined Shahrood University of Technology, Iran, as an Assistant Professor. His primary research focus is on compressive sensing, sparse representation, dictionary learning, image and signal processing, and computer vision. Most of his research findings and proposed solutions e.g. in medical applications, biometrics, and computer vision have been published in high quality journals and conferences. Currently, he is working toward expanding the usability of his theoretical knowledge and expertise in new industrial and practical real-life applications such as compressive sensing for smart and low-power sensing and communication technologies, artificial intelligence for healthcare and global environmental challenges, etc. Dr Abolghasemi is a Senior Member of IEEE and has won IEEE young investigator award in 2018. He has been a guest editor of several scientific journals such as 'Sensors', 'Journal of Biomedical Imaging' and 'Frontiers in Neuroscience'. He serves as a reviewer of numerous journals such as IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, IEEE Signal Processing Letters, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks & Learning Systems, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, Signal processing, etc. [*Prospective PhD students who have related research interests are encouraged to contact me by email*] Qualifications PhD University of Surrey, (2011) Appointments University of Essex Lecturer, Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex (1/7/2019 - present) Other academic Assistant Professor, Shahrood University of Technology (1/1/2013 - 30/6/2019) Post-doctoral Research Assistant, Brunel University London (1/12/2011 - 31/12/2012) Research and professional activities Research interests Signal processing Open to supervise Image processing Open to supervise Compressive sensing Open to supervise Inverse problems and sparse recovery Open to supervise Dictionary learning image classification, signal classification, denoising, artifact removal Open to supervise Biomedical signal and image processing Open to supervise Machine learning and pattern recognition Open to supervise Computer Vision Open to supervise Teaching and supervision Current teaching responsibilities Engineering Electromagnetics (CE266) Individual Capstone Project Challenge (CE301) Individual Project (CE601) Current supervision Sumit Kumar Singh Thesis title: Diagnosis of Skin Cancer Using Novel Computer Vision and Deep Learning Techniques Degree subject: Computer Science Degree type: Master of Science (by Dissertation) Atitaya PhoemsUK Degree subject: Computer Science Degree type: Doctor of Philosophy Publications Journal articles (34) Abolghasemi, V. and Anisi, MH., (2021).
