We investigate the chemistry and biology of small molecules, peptides, and proteins that participate in the human innate immune response and host/pathogen interaction, and contribute to microbial pathogenesis. In many projects, we emphasize how transition metals, and metal-ion chelators produced by either the host or microbe, contribute to these phenomena. Our experimental approach combines the techniques of inorganic and organic chemistries, biological chemistry, and microbiology.
