Black Distinguished Professor of ECE, has been awarded $36 million over 10 years to lead a new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) multi-institutional Center of Excellence, SENTRY (Soft target Engineering to Neutralize the Threat RealitY). SENTRY will develop a Virtual Sentry system that provides just-in-time information to key decision makers to protect civilian soft targets such as transit stations and schools, and crowded spaces such as stadiums from covert threats. Student GroupsAug 20, 2021NU Team PARIS Wins in Phase 1 of American-Made E-ROBOT PrizeA Northeastern faculty and student team was awarded a $200K prize as a finalist for Phase 1 of the U.S. Department of Energys American-Made Challenges E-ROBOT Prize. In Phase 2, up to four teams (from the 10 finalists) will receive a $500K award. The teams submission proposed development of a Precise Air-sealing Robot for Inaccessible Spaces (PARIS). The Northeastern team is advised by ECE Associate Professor Taskin Padir, CEE Assistant Professor Michael Kane, and ECE Distinguished Professor Carey Rappaport. FacultyApr 16, 2021Silevitch to Direct New AI Jumpstart ProgramECE Professor Michael Silevitch will lead a new Massachusetts program,AI Jumpstart, to connect small business owners in the state with academic faculty experts to learn how machine learning can grow their companies. Northeastern received a $2.2 million state grant that will be used primarily for high-speed computer equipment and also to provide for faculty consultants, both of which will be available to selected companies to get the pilot effort up and running. Northeastern kicked in an additional $2 million, raising the programs total value to more than $4 million. AlumniMar 02, 2021The Triple Husky ExperienceSarah Brown is a true Northeastern success story: a triple Husky who earned her bachelors in electrical engineering, E11, masters in electrical and computer engineering, ME14, and a doctorate in electrical engineering, PhD16. After completing her doctorate, she was awarded the University of California at Berkeley Chancellors Postdoctoral Fellowship and served as a postdoctoral research [] Mar 12, 2020Northeastern Spearheading Advances in Travel SafetyNortheasterns ALERT(Awareness and Localization of Explosives-Related Threats)is one of nine Department of Homeland (DHS) Security Centers of Excellence (COEs) located across the country. A multi-university center, ALERT conducts research and development for effective responses to explosives-related threats. ALERT is funded by a core grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate that equates to roughly $3.6 million a year. In addition to the Centers ongoing core research award, DHS also provides each COE with an ability to obtain task order contracts targeted to develop specific security technologies and methods.
