Audience Tools Search Menu Faculty > Joe Bak-Coleman Joe Bak-Coleman CV Postdoctoral Scholar joebak@uw.edu Gerberding Hall 054 Specializations Collective Behaviour Complexity Science Behavioural Ecology Research Areas Information and Society Sociotechnical Information Systems Biography Dr. Joe Bak-Coleman is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington Center for an Informed Public. His research focuses on how the actions and interactions of group members give rise to broader patterns of collective action. He is particularly interested in understanding how communication technology alters collective decision-making and the spread of information. To ask these questions, he uses a combination of online experiments, observational data and mathematical modelling. Joe Bak-Coleman earned his Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University. Prior to working on human collective behaviour, he studied the behaviour of animal groups zebra herds to fish schools.
