Anderson, PhD Professor, Chemical Engineering and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science Member, Marble Center for Cancer Nanomedicine Associate Member, Broad Institute Associate Member, Ragon Institute KI Research Areas of Focus:Nano-based Drugs, Personalized Medicine, Cancer Immunology "Our laboratory works at the interface of biology and engineering to develop new medical devices and human therapies.For example, we are working to create nanoparticles that can deliver genetic therapy inside of cells, or even perform genome editing in vivo.We are also developing living therapeutics, constructed from human cells and biomaterials, that can provide long-term therapy for chronic diseases such as diabetes.Finally, we are seeking to create smart biomaterials and responsive drug delivery systems that can integrate with the body and provide customized, on-demand treatment for patients." Learn more about the work that Professor Andersons lab is doing to create tiny nanoparticles that can deliver RNA to a cancer cell to stop tumor growth by watching this video: "Inside the Lab: Daniel G. Anderson, Ph.D." Daniel G. Anderson is a leading researcher in the field of nanotherapeutics and biomaterials. He is appointed in the Department of Chemical Engineering, the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Science and Technology at MIT. The research done in Prof. Andersons laboratory is focused on developing new materials for medicine. He has pioneered the development of smart biomaterials, and his work has led to advances in a range of areas, including medical devices, cell therapy, drug delivery, gene therapy and material science. Prof. Anderson received a B.A. in mathematics and biology from the University of California at Santa Cruz and a Ph.D. in molecular genetics from the University of California at Davis. His work has resulted in the publication of over 400 papers, patents and patent applications. These advances have led products that have been commercialized or are in clinical development, as well as to the foundation of companies in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer products space. Dr. Anderson is a founder of Living Proof, Olivo Labs, Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP), Sigilon Therapeutics, Verseau Therapeutics, VasoRx, and Orna. Further Information Research Summary We seek to combine biology and engineering to develop new human therapies. One particularly important problem is the quest to deliver drugs, inside of specific cell targets, in vivo. There are many macromolecular drugs, such as DNA, RNA and some proteins, with great therapeutic potential that will only function when inside of a cell.We have developed synthetic nanoparticles that can act like artificial viruses, delivering genetic therapies in vivo to selectively turn genes off, turn them on, or even permanently edit the genome.We are also working to develop new biomaterials and approaches to tissue engineering.By developing smart biomaterials that can interact appropriately with the immune system, we have made living medical devices, that can secrete drugs on demand as needed by the body for chronic disease such as diabetes.Finally, we continue to focus our efforts towards developing next generation nanotherapeutics for cancer, by developing vaccines and methods to control immune cell function.These advances have led products that have been commercialized or are in clinical development, as well as to the foundation of companies in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer products space.
