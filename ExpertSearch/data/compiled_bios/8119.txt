Shafarman joined the Materials Science Department after working since 1986 at the Institute of Energy Conversion where he is now the Director. His research group investigates materials, processing, and characterization of compound semiconductors for their application in thin film solar cells and related optoelectronic applications. This research has had a particular emphasis on copper indium gallium diselenide [Cu(InGa)Se2] and related alloys along with newer, promising materials including hybrid perovskites. At IEC, these thin films are deposited using a wide range of processes and in the fabrication of complete solar cell devices. The main objective of this research is to explore the complex relationships between processing, materials properties, device design, and electronic characteristics of the solar cells. In this work, he has collaborated extensively with university and industrial research groups both in the US and internationally. Dr. Shafarman earned his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Rochester after earning his B.S. in physics from the University of Delaware. Research Interests Alloying and bandgap engineering of thin film chalcogenide materials New compound materials for photovoltaics and related optoelectronic applications Design and validation of new device structures and contacts Development thin film deposition processes to facilitate manufacturing scale-up Representative Publications The Growth of Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskites by Close Space Vapor Transport Alexander J.
