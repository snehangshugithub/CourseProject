He currently specializes in Computational Tools for Asset & Project Management. Professor Hegazi is looking to utilize recent advances in computational tools that are able to optimize construction operations, improve work productivity, and solve complex problems. Along with this focus is the simplification of the underlying advanced concepts through the use of customary computer platforms, such as spreadsheets, to broaden the applicability of such concepts in the industry. The main directions are: Intelligent decision support systems for applications characterized by high uncertainty and risk; Integration and optimization of techniques for time, cost, and quality control; Developing computerized models such as asset management systems, discrete-event simulation, design, construction, coordination, estimating, bidding, corrective actions, project control, forecasting, and productivity enhancement. As a result of his work, Professor Hegazi has received numerous research excellence honours and awards. In 2004, he was acknowledged as one of the worlds top 5 contributing authors to ASCE construction research, as reported in the Journal of Construction Engineering and Management article, Vol. 130, No. 3. Professor Hegazi holds 2 patents, a 2011 Best Paper award from the Journal of Management in Engineering-ASCE, and Top Cited Paper award from the Advanced Engineering Informatics Journal. He has consulted and advised a number of contractors and government organizations in Canada and is also the founder of OPTEAM Project Management Consultants Inc. In addition, Professor Hegazi is the author of the textbook "Computer-Based Construction Project Management" published by Prentice Hall.Research InterestsStructuresMechanics & ConstructionAsset ManagementPlanning and SchedulingProject ControlOptimizationProject ManagementGeographic Information SystemsComputer ApplicationsEvolutionary AlgorithmsDecision Support SystemsEconomics of Infrastructure StabilityPPPbudgeting and backlogApplication of Neural NetworksGenetic AlgorithmsFuzzy LogicEducation1993, Doctorate, Construction Management (Building Studies), Concordia University1986, Master's, Civil Engineering, University of Michigan1981, Bachelor's, Civil Engineering, Ain Shams University, Civil Engineering DepartmentCourses*CIVE 400 - Civil Eng'g Des Project 1Taught in 2017CIVE 401 - Civil Eng Design Project 2Taught in 2017CIVE 596 - Construction EngineeringTaught in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021CIVE 710 - Advanced Project ManagementTaught in 2016, 2018, 2020, 2021CIVE 711 - CA Project ManagementTaught in 2018, 2019, 2021* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsRashedi, Roozbeh and Hegazy, Tarek, Strategic policy analysis for infrastructure rehabilitation using system dynamics, Structure and Infrastructure Engineering, 12(6), 2016, 667 - 681Rashedi, Roozbeh and Hegazy, Tarek, Examining budget policies for new and existing facilities: a system dynamics approach, Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 43(999), 2016, 511 - 522Abuwarda, Zinab and Hegazy, Tarek, Flexible Activity Relations to Support Optimum Schedule Acceleration, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 2016Abuwarda, Zinab and Hegazy, Tarek, Work-Package Planning and Schedule Optimization for Projects with Evolving Constraints, Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering, 2016Abdel-Monem, Mohamed and Abuwarda, Zinab and Hegazy, Tarek, Progress tracking of multiple projects using email and voice, , 2015Graduate StudiesCurrently considering applications from graduate students.
