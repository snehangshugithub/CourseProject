Biography Karen M. Wickett is an Assistant Professor in the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois. Her research areas include the conceptual and logical foundations of information organization systems and artifacts. She is most interested in the analysis of common concepts in information systems, such as documents, datasets, databases, digital objects, metadata records, and collections. Before joining the faculty at the iSchool at Illinois, Wickett was on the faculty of the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin, where she taught courses and conducted research on information modeling and conceptual modeling in data curation. Prior to her faculty appointment at UT Austin, Wickett was a postdoctoral research associate for the Center for Informatics Research in Science and Scholarship (CIRSS) at the iSchool.
