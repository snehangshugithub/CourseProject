He leads a $1.5 million initiative to establish a cutting-edge mass spectrometry facility and strong research program in solid Earth geochemistry and environmental biogeochemistry at Waterloo. Contact informationOffice: EIT 5023AEmail: bkendall@uwaterloo.ca Website: Research and Teaching Expertise Professor Kendall uses geochemistry to develop innovative geochemical methods that can serve as process tracers for petroleum systems, ore mineralization, and biogeochemical cycles; learn more about how mineral and petroleum deposits form and improve exploration strategies for these important resources; reconstruct the history of atmosphere and ocean oxygenation through time and its relationship to biological evolution, seawater chemistry and natural resource deposits. Research Specific research themes include metal isotope geochemistry of petroleum and implications for oil-oil and oil-source rock correlations; inorganic geochemistry (trace element concentrations and metal isotope compositions) of conventional and unconventional petroleum source rocks and economic and environmental implications for energy development; metal isotope geochemistry and geochronology of ore deposits and implications for ore formation and exploration; the co-evolution of Earth's surface oxygenation, metal biogeochemical cycles, and biological evolution over time, as inferred from trace element concentrations and the Mo, U, and Os isotope compositions of sedimentary rocks; sedimentary geochronology using the Re-Os isotope system.
