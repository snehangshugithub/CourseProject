AREAS OF RESEARCH INTERESTS Environmental Analytical Chemistry; Environmental Health; Water Resources Research; Development of Analytical Methods with Atomic Spectroscopy and Chromatography; Science Education. Research Programs Water Resources Research: There are three research themes that focus on water resources: (1) investigation of microbial mediation in phosphate removal by wetlands, (2) chemical characterization of biosolids and their impact on ground water quality, and (3) studies of emerging contaminants. These research efforts are supported by an analytical facility that consists of state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation for the determination of nutrients (phosphates and nitrates), heavy metals, organic pollutants, pharmaceuticals and personal care product contaminants. Study of Environmental Processes at the Molecular Level: This research is focused on studying the interaction of chemical species with solid surfaces and the mitigating effects of these interactions on environmental contamination. It looks at environmental processes at the molecular level, seeking to elucidate how the natural environment is affected by contaminants, and how the affected environment can be restored. The materials under investigation include soils and sediments; bio-materials such as plants and bio-solids; natural organic matter; synthetic chelating agents; and naturally occurring polymers. Heavy Metal Speciation Studies: This work is aimed at investigating the forms in which heavy metals exist in environmental systems and the factors that influence their distribution. The study has led to the development of new analytical methods which have been applied in the elucidation of the toxicity and other biological effects of heavy metals. Distribution and Fate of Hazardous Substances in Environmental Systems: This research is aimed at studying the chemistry of pesticides, heavy metals, and other toxic substances in environmental systems. By knowing how these materials behave under various conditions, analytical methods for identifying and quantifying them can be developed.
